       ggrreepp  searches the named input _F_I_L_Es (or standard input if
       no files are named, or if a  single  hyphen-minus  (--)  is
       given  as  file  name) for lines containing a match to the
       given _P_A_T_T_E_R_N.   By  default,  ggrreepp  prints  the  matching
       lines.

       In  addition,  two  variant  programs  eeggrreepp and ffggrreepp are
       available.  eeggrreepp is the same as ggrreepp --EE.   ffggrreepp  is  the
       same  as  ggrreepp --FF.   Direct  invocation as either eeggrreepp or
       ffggrreepp is deprecated, but is provided to  allow  historical
       applications that rely on them to run unmodified.

       --ff _F_I_L_E, ----ffiillee==_F_I_L_E
              Obtain patterns from _F_I_L_E, one per line.  The empty
              file  contains zero patterns, and therefore matches
              nothing.  (--ff is specified by POSIX.)

       --ii, ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              Ignore case distinctions in both  the  _P_A_T_T_E_R_N  and
              the input files.  (--ii is specified by POSIX.)

       --vv, ----iinnvveerrtt--mmaattcchh
              Invert  the  sense  of  matching,  to  select  non-
              matching lines.  (--vv is specified by POSIX.)

       --ww, ----wwoorrdd--rreeggeexxpp
              Select only those  lines  containing  matches  that
              form  whole  words.   The test is that the matching
              substring must either be at the  beginning  of  the
              line,   or   preceded  by  a  non-word  constituent
              character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end
              of  the  line or followed by a non-word constituent
              character.    Word-constituent    characters    are
              letters, digits, and the underscore.

       --xx, ----lliinnee--rreeggeexxpp
              Select  only  those  matches that exactly match the

              Suppress normal output; instead print  a  count  of
              matching  lines  for each input file.  With the --vv,
              ----iinnvveerrtt--mmaattcchh  option  (see  below),  count   non-

              Surround  the matched (non-empty) strings, matching
              lines, context lines,  file  names,  line  numbers,
              byte offsets, and separators (for fields and groups
              of context lines) with escape sequences to  display
              them  in  color  on  the  terminal.  The colors are
              defined by the  environment  variable  GGRREEPP__CCOOLLOORRSS.
              The  deprecated  environment variable GGRREEPP__CCOOLLOORR is
              still supported, but  its  setting  does  not  have
              priority.  _W_H_E_N is nneevveerr, aallwwaayyss, or aauuttoo.

       --ll, ----ffiilleess--wwiitthh--mmaattcchheess
              Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of
              each  input  file  from which output would normally
              have been printed.  The scanning will stop  on  the

       --mm _N_U_M, ----mmaaxx--ccoouunntt==_N_U_M
              Stop  reading  a file after _N_U_M matching lines.  If
              the input is standard input from  a  regular  file,
              and  _N_U_M  matching  lines  are output, ggrreepp ensures
              that the standard input is positioned to just after
              the  last  matching line before exiting, regardless
              of the presence of trailing  context  lines.   This
              enables a calling process to resume a search.  When
              ggrreepp stops after _N_U_M matching lines, it outputs any
              trailing  context  lines.   When  the --cc or ----ccoouunntt
              option is also used, ggrreepp does not output  a  count
              greater  than  _N_U_M.   When the --vv or ----iinnvveerrtt--mmaattcchh
              option is also used, ggrreepp  stops  after  outputting
              _N_U_M non-matching lines.

       --oo, ----oonnllyy--mmaattcchhiinngg
              Print  only  the  matched  (non-empty)  parts  of a
              matching line, with each such part  on  a  separate
              output line.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett, ----ssiilleenntt
              Quiet;  do  not  write anything to standard output.
              Exit immediately with zero status if any  match  is
              found, even if an error was detected.  Also see the
              --ss or ----nnoo--mmeessssaaggeess option.  (--qq  is  specified  by
              POSIX.)

       --ss, ----nnoo--mmeessssaaggeess
              Suppress   error   messages  about  nonexistent  or
              unreadable files.   Portability  note:  unlike  GNU
              ggrreepp,  7th  Edition  Unix  ggrreepp  did not conform to
              POSIX, because it  lacked  --qq  and  its  --ss  option
              behaved  like GNU ggrreepp's --qq option.  USG-style ggrreepp
              also lacked --qq but its --ss option behaved  like  GNU
              ggrreepp.   Portable shell scripts should avoid both --qq
              and --ss  and  should  redirect  standard  and  error
              output  to  //ddeevv//nnuullll instead.  (--ss is specified by
              POSIX.)

              before    each    line    of    output.     If   --oo
              (----oonnllyy--mmaattcchhiinngg) is specified, print the offset of
              the matching part itself.

       --HH, ----wwiitthh--ffiilleennaammee
              Print  the  file  name for each match.  This is the
              default when there is more than one file to search.

       --hh, ----nnoo--ffiilleennaammee
              Suppress  the  prefixing  of  file names on output.
              This is the default when there is only one file (or
              only standard input) to search.

       ----llaabbeell==_L_A_B_E_L
              Display  input  actually coming from standard input
              as  input  coming  from  file   _L_A_B_E_L_.    This   is
              especially  useful for tools like zzggrreepp, e.g., ggzziipp

       --nn, ----lliinnee--nnuummbbeerr
              Prefix each line of output with  the  1-based  line
              number  within its input file.  (--nn is specified by
              POSIX.)

       --TT, ----iinniittiiaall--ttaabb
              Make sure that the first character of  actual  line
              content  lies  on a tab stop, so that the alignment
              of tabs looks normal.  This is useful with  options
              that  prefix  their  output  to the actual content:
              --HH,--nn, and --bb.  In order to improve the probability
              that lines from a single file will all start at the
              same column, this also causes the line  number  and
              byte offset (if present) to be printed in a minimum
              size field width.

       --uu, ----uunniixx--bbyyttee--ooffffsseettss
              Report Unix-style byte offsets.  This switch causes
              ggrreepp  to  report byte offsets as if the file were a
              Unix-style text  file,  i.e.,  with  CR  characters
              stripped  off.  This will produce results identical
              to running ggrreepp on a Unix machine.  This option has
              no  effect unless --bb option is also used; it has no
              effect on  platforms  other  than  MS-DOS  and  MS-
              Windows.

       --ZZ, ----nnuullll
              Output  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII  NNUULL  character)
              instead of the character that  normally  follows  a
              file  name.   For  example, ggrreepp --llZZ outputs a zero
              byte after each file  name  instead  of  the  usual
              newline.  This option makes the output unambiguous,
              even in  the  presence  of  file  names  containing
              unusual  characters like newlines.  This option can
              be used with commands like ffiinndd --pprriinntt00,  ppeerrll  --00,
              ssoorrtt  --zz,  and  xxaarrggss  --00 to process arbitrary file
              names, even those that contain newline  characters.

              of type _T_Y_P_E.  By default, _T_Y_P_E is bbiinnaarryy, and ggrreepp
              normally  outputs  either a one-line message saying
              that a binary file matches, or no message if  there
              is  no  match.   If  _T_Y_P_E  is  wwiitthhoouutt--mmaattcchh,  ggrreepp
              assumes that a binary file does not match; this  is
              equivalent to the --II option.  If _T_Y_P_E is tteexxtt, ggrreepp
              processes a binary file as if it were text; this is
              equivalent   to   the  --aa  option.   _W_a_r_n_i_n_g_:  ggrreepp

              which  can have nasty side effects if the output is

       A  regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of
       strings.  Regular expressions are constructed  analogously
       to  arithmetic  expressions, by using various operators to
       combine smaller expressions.

       ggrreepp  understands  two  different  versions   of   regular
       expression  syntax:  "basic" and "extended."  In GNU ggrreepp,
       there is no difference in  available  functionality  using
       either  syntax.   In  other implementations, basic regular
       expressions are less powerful.  The following  description
       applies  to  extended regular expressions; differences for
       basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.

       The  fundamental   building   blocks   are   the   regular
       expressions   that   match   a   single  character.   Most
       characters, including all letters and digits, are  regular
       expressions  that  match  themselves.   Any meta-character
       with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with  a
       backslash.

       The period .. matches any single character.

   CChhaarraacctteerr CCllaasssseess aanndd BBrraacckkeett EExxpprreessssiioonnss
       A _b_r_a_c_k_e_t _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is a list of characters enclosed by [[
       and ]].  It matches any single character in that  list;  if
       the  first  character  of  the list is the caret ^^ then it
       matches any character _n_o_t in the list.  For  example,  the
       regular  expression [[00112233445566778899]] matches any single digit.

       Within a bracket expression, a _r_a_n_g_e  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  consists
       of  two  characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any
       single character that sorts between  the  two  characters,
       inclusive,  using  the  locale's  collating  sequence  and
       character set.  For example,  in  the  default  C  locale,
       [[aa--dd]]   is   equivalent  to  [[aabbccdd]].   Many  locales  sort
       characters in dictionary order, and in these locales [[aa--dd]]
       is  typically  not  equivalent  to  [[aabbccdd]];  it  might  be
       equivalent to  [[aaBBbbCCccDDdd]],  for  example.   To  obtain  the
       traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can

       use  the  C  locale  by  setting  the  LLCC__AALLLL  environment
       variable to the value CC.

       Finally,   certain   named   classes   of  characters  are
       predefined within bracket expressions, as follows.   Their
       names  are  self  explanatory,  and  they  are  [[::aallnnuumm::]],
       [[::aallpphhaa::]],  [[::ccnnttrrll::]],  [[::ddiiggiitt::]],  [[::ggrraapphh::]],  [[::lloowweerr::]],

       [[::xxddiiggiitt::]]..  For example, [[[[::aallnnuumm::]]]]  means  [[00--99AA--ZZaa--zz]],
       except  the  latter form depends upon the C locale and the
       ASCII  character   encoding,   whereas   the   former   is
       independent  of  locale and character set.  (Note that the
       brackets in these class names are  part  of  the  symbolic
       names,  and  must  be included in addition to the brackets
       delimiting the bracket expression.)  Most  meta-characters
       lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To
       include  a  literal  ]]  place  it  first  in   the   list.
       Similarly,  to  include  a literal ^^ place it anywhere but
       first.  Finally, to include a literal -- place it last.

       empty string provided it's _n_o_t at the edge of a word.  The
       symbol \\ww is a synonym for [[[[::aallnnuumm::]]]] and \\WW is a synonym

       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ??, ++,  {{,

       Traditional eeggrreepp did not support  the  {{  meta-character,
       and  some  eeggrreepp  implementations  support  \\{{ instead, so
       portable scripts should avoid {{ in  ggrreepp --EE  patterns  and
       should use [[{{]] to match a literal {{.

       GNU  ggrreepp --EE  attempts  to  support  traditional  usage by
       assuming that {{ is not special if it would be the start of
       an  invalid  interval  specification.   For  example,  the

       {{11  instead  of  reporting  a  syntax error in the regular

       that order.  The first of  these  variables  that  is  set

       but LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS  is  set  to  pptt__BBRR,  then  the  Brazilian

       The  C  locale  is  used  if  none  of  these  environment

                     lines when --vv is specified).  If however the
                     boolean rrvv capability and  the  --vv  command-
                     line  option  are both specified, it applies
                     to  context  matching  lines  instead.   The
                     default   is  empty  (i.e.,  the  terminal's
                     default color pair).

              ccxx==    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e.,
                     non-matching  lines when the --vv command-line
                     option is omitted, or matching lines when --vv
                     is  specified).   If  however the boolean rrvv
                     capability and the  --vv  command-line  option
                     are  both  specified, it applies to selected

                     empty  (i.e.,  the  terminal's default color

                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in

                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in

                     ends.   This is needed on terminals on which
                     EL is not supported.  It is otherwise useful

                     slow   or  causes  too  much  flicker.   The
                     default is false (i.e.,  the  capability  is
                     omitted).

              Note  that boolean capabilities have no ==...  part.
              They are  omitted  (i.e.,  false)  by  default  and

              otherwise,  ggrreepp  behaves  more  like   other   GNU
              programs.    POSIX.2  requires  that  options  that
              follow file names must be treated as file names; by
              default,  such options are permuted to the front of
              the operand list and are treated as options.  Also,
              POSIX.2   requires  that  unrecognized  options  be
              diagnosed as "illegal",  but  since  they  are  not
              really  against  the law the default is to diagnose
              them as "invalid".  PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT  also  disables

              (Here  _N is ggrreepp's numeric process ID.)  If the _ith
              character of this environment variable's  value  is
              11, do not consider the _ith operand of ggrreepp to be an
              option, even if it appears to be one.  A shell  can
              put  this  variable  in  the  environment  for each
              command it runs, specifying which operands are  the
              results   of   file  name  wildcard  expansion  and
              therefore should not be treated as  options.   This
              behavior  is available only with the GNU C library,
              and only when PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT is not set.

       Normally, the exit status is 0 if selected lines are found
       and  1  otherwise.   But  the exit status is 2 if an error
       occurred, unless the --qq or ----qquuiieett or ----ssiilleenntt  option  is
       used  and  a  selected line is found.  Note, however, that
       POSIX only mandates, for programs such as ggrreepp,  ccmmpp,  and
       ddiiffff,  that  the  exit  status in case of error be greater
       than 1;  it  is  therefore  advisable,  for  the  sake  of
       portability,  to  use  logic  that  tests for this general
       condition instead of strict equality with 2.
