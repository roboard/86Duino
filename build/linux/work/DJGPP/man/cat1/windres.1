       wwiinnddrreess reads resources from an input file and copies them
       into  an  output file.  Either file may be in one of three
       formats:

       "rc"
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

       "res"
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

       "coff"
           A COFF object or executable.

       The  exact  description  of  these  different  formats  is
       available in documentation from Microsoft.

       When  wwiinnddrreess  converts  from the "rc" format to the "res"
       format, it is acting like the Windows  Resource  Compiler.
       When  wwiinnddrreess converts from the "res" format to the "coff"
       format, it is acting like the Windows "CVTRES" program.

       When wwiinnddrreess generates an "rc" file, the output is similar
       but  not  identical  to the format expected for the input.
       When an input "rc" file refers to an external filename, an
       output "rc" file will instead include the file contents.

       If  the  input  or output format is not specified, wwiinnddrreess
       will guess based on the file name, or, for the input file,
       the  file  contents.  A file with an extension of _._r_c will
       be treated as an "rc" file, a file with  an  extension  of
       _._r_e_s  will  be treated as a "res" file, and a file with an
       extension of _._o or _._e_x_e will be treated as a "coff"  file.

       If  no  output  file  is specified, wwiinnddrreess will print the
       resources in "rc" format to standard output.

       The normal use is for you  to  write  an  "rc"  file,  use
       wwiinnddrreess to convert it to a COFF object file, and then link
       the COFF file into your application.  This will  make  the
       resources described in the "rc" file available to Windows.

           option arguments, then wwiinnddrreess will read from standard
           input.  wwiinnddrreess can not read a COFF file from standard
           input.

       ----oouuttppuutt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           The  name  of  the output file.  If this option is not
           used, then  wwiinnddrreess  will  use  the  first  non-option
           argument,  after  any used for the input file name, as
           the output file  name.   If  there  is  no  non-option
           argument,  then wwiinnddrreess will write to standard output.
           wwiinnddrreess can not write a COFF file to standard  output.
           Note, for compatibility with rrcc the option --ffoo is also
           accepted, but its use is not recommended.

       ----iinnppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
           The input format to read.  _f_o_r_m_a_t may be rreess,  rrcc,  or
           ccooffff.   If  no input format is specified, wwiinnddrreess will
           guess, as described above.

       ----oouuttppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
           The output format to generate.  _f_o_r_m_a_t may be rreess, rrcc,
           or  ccooffff.   If  no output format is specified, wwiinnddrreess
           will guess, as described above.

       ----ttaarrggeett _t_a_r_g_e_t
           Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input
           or output.  This is a BFD target name; you can use the
           ----hheellpp option to see  a  list  of  supported  targets.
           Normally wwiinnddrreess will use the default format, which is
           the first one listed by the ----hheellpp option.

           When wwiinnddrreess reads an "rc" file, it  runs  it  through
           the  C preprocessor first.  This option may be used to
           specify the preprocessor to use, including any leading
           arguments.   The default preprocessor argument is "gcc
           -E -xc-header -DRC_INVOKED".

       --II _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

           Specify an include directory to use  when  reading  an
           "rc" file.  wwiinnddrreess will pass this to the preprocessor
           as an  --II  option.   wwiinnddrreess  will  also  search  this
           directory  when  looking  for  files named in the "rc"
           file.  If the argument passed to this command  matches
           any  of  the supported _f_o_r_m_a_t_s (as described in the --JJ
           option), it will  issue  a  deprecation  warning,  and
           behave  just  like the --JJ option.  New programs should
           not use this behaviour.  If  a  directory  happens  to

           match  a  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  simple prefix it with ..// to disable
           the backward compatibility.

       ----ddeeffiinnee _s_y_m[[==_v_a_l]]
           Specify a --DD option to pass to the  preprocessor  when
           reading an "rc" file.

       --UU _t_a_r_g_e_t
       ----uunnddeeffiinnee _s_y_m
           Specify  a  --UU option to pass to the preprocessor when
           reading an "rc" file.

       --rr  Ignored for compatibility with rc.

       --vv  Enable  verbose  mode.   This  tells  you   what   the
           preprocessor is if you didn't specify one.

       --cc _v_a_l
       ----ccooddeeppaaggee _v_a_l
           Specify  the  default  codepage to use when reading an
           "rc" file.  _v_a_l should be a hexadecimal prefixed by 00xx
           or decimal codepage code. The valid range is from zero
           up to 0xffff, but the validity of the codepage is host
           and configuration dependent.

       --ll _v_a_l
       ----llaanngguuaaggee _v_a_l
           Specify  the  default  language to use when reading an
           "rc" file.  _v_a_l should be a hexadecimal language code.
           The  low  eight  bits  are  the language, and the high
           eight bits are the sublanguage.

       ----uussee--tteemmpp--ffiillee
           Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read
           the output of the preprocessor. Use this option if the
           popen  implementation  is  buggy  on  the  host  (eg.,
           certain  non-English  language  versions of Windows 95
           and Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where the
           output will instead go the console).

       ----nnoo--uussee--tteemmpp--ffiillee
           Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of
           the preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

           this will turn on parser debugging.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the  original  @_f_i_l_e  option.
           If  _f_i_l_e  does  not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace  character  may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire  option  in  either  single  or
           double  quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included  by  prefixing  the  character  to  be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e  options;  any  such  options
           will be processed recursively.
