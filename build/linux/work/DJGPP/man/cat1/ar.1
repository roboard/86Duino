       The GNU aarr program creates, modifies,  and  extracts  from
       archives.    An   _a_r_c_h_i_v_e  is  a  single  file  holding  a
       collection of other files in a  structure  that  makes  it
       possible to retrieve the original individual files (called
       _m_e_m_b_e_r_s of the archive).

       The  original   files'   contents,   mode   (permissions),
       timestamp,  owner, and group are preserved in the archive,
       and can be restored on extraction.

       GNU aarr can maintain archives whose members have  names  of
       any  length; however, depending on how aarr is configured on
       your system, a limit on member-name length may be  imposed
       for  compatibility  with  archive  formats maintained with
       other  tools.   If  it  exists,  the  limit  is  often  15
       characters  (typical  of  formats  related to a.out) or 16
       characters (typical of formats related to coff).

       aarr is considered a binary utility because archives of this
       sort  are  most  often  used as _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s holding commonly
       needed subroutines.

       aarr creates an index to the symbols defined in  relocatable
       object  modules  in  the  archive  when  you  specify  the
       modifier ss.  Once created, this index is  updated  in  the
       archive  whenever  aarr makes a change to its contents (save
       for the qq update operation).   An  archive  with  such  an
       index  speeds  up  linking  to  the  library,  and  allows
       routines in the library to call each other without  regard
       to their placement in the archive.

       You  may  use nnmm --ss or nnmm ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp to list this index
       table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of  aarr
       called rraannlliibb can be used to add just the table.

       GNU  aarr  can  optionally  create  a  _t_h_i_n  archive,  which
       contains a symbol index and  references  to  the  original
       copies  of  the  member  files  of  the archives.  Such an
       archive is useful for building libraries for use within  a
       local build, where the relocatable objects are expected to
       remain available, and copying the contents of each  object
       would  only  waste time and space.  Thin archives are also
       _f_l_a_t_t_e_n_e_d, so that adding one or more archives to  a  thin
       archive  will  add  the  elements  of  the  nested archive
       individually.  The paths to the elements  of  the  archive
       are stored relative to the archive itself.

       GNU  aarr  is  designed  to be compatible with two different
       facilities.  You can control its activity  using  command-
       line  options,  like the different varieties of aarr on Unix
       systems; or, if you specify the single command-line option
       --MM, you can control it with a script supplied via standard
       input, like the MRI "librarian" program.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       GNU aarr allows you to mix the operation code _p and modifier
       flags  _m_o_d  in  any  order,  within the first command-line
       argument.

       If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument
       with a dash.

       The  _p  keyletter  specifies what operation to execute; it
       may be any of the following, but you must specify only one
       of them:

       dd   _D_e_l_e_t_e modules from the archive.  Specify the names of
           modules to be deleted as  _m_e_m_b_e_r...;  the  archive  is
           untouched if you specify no files to delete.

           If you specify the vv modifier, aarr lists each module as
           it is deleted.

       mm   Use this operation to _m_o_v_e members in an archive.

           The ordering of members  in  an  archive  can  make  a
           difference  in  how  programs  are  linked  using  the
           library, if a symbol  is  defined  in  more  than  one
           member.

           If  no  modifiers  are  used with "m", any members you
           name in the _m_e_m_b_e_r arguments are moved to the  _e_n_d  of
           the  archive;  you can use the aa, bb, or ii modifiers to
           move them to a specified place instead.

       pp   _P_r_i_n_t the specified members of  the  archive,  to  the
           standard output file.  If the vv modifier is specified,
           show the member name before copying  its  contents  to
           standard output.

           If  you  specify no _m_e_m_b_e_r arguments, all the files in
           the archive are printed.

       qq   _Q_u_i_c_k _a_p_p_e_n_d; Historically, add the files _m_e_m_b_e_r... to
           the  end of _a_r_c_h_i_v_e, without checking for replacement.

           The  modifiers  aa,  bb,  and  ii  do  _n_o_t  affect   this
           operation; new members are always placed at the end of
           the archive.

           The modifier vv makes  aarr  list  each  file  as  it  is

           appended.

           Since  the  point  of  this  operation  is  speed, the
           archive's symbol table index is not updated,  even  if
           it  already  existed;  you  can  use  aarr  ss  or rraannlliibb
           explicitly to update the symbol table index.

           However,  too  many  different  systems  assume  quick
           append rebuilds the index, so GNU aarr implements qq as a
           synonym for rr.

       rr   Insert  the  files  _m_e_m_b_e_r...   into   _a_r_c_h_i_v_e   (with
           _r_e_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t).  This  operation  differs from qq in that
           any previously existing members are deleted  if  their
           names match those being added.

           If one of the files named in _m_e_m_b_e_r... does not exist,
           aarr displays an error message, and  leaves  undisturbed
           any  existing  members  of  the  archive matching that
           name.

           By default, new members are added at the  end  of  the
           file;  but you may use one of the modifiers aa, bb, or ii
           to request placement relative to some existing member.

           The modifier vv used with this operation elicits a line
           of output for each file inserted, along  with  one  of
           the  letters  aa  or rr to indicate whether the file was
           appended (no old member deleted) or replaced.

       tt   Display a _t_a_b_l_e listing the contents  of  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e,  or
           those  of  the  files  listed  in  _m_e_m_b_e_r...  that are
           present in the archive.  Normally only the member name
           is   shown;   if  you  also  want  to  see  the  modes
           (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size,  you
           can request that by also specifying the vv modifier.

           If  you  do  not  specify  a  _m_e_m_b_e_r, all files in the
           archive are listed.

           If there is more than one  file  with  the  same  name
           (say, ffiiee) in an archive (say bb..aa), aarr tt bb..aa ffiiee lists
           only the first instance; to see them all, you must ask
           for a complete listing---in our example, aarr tt bb..aa.

       xx   _E_x_t_r_a_c_t  members (named _m_e_m_b_e_r) from the archive.  You
           can use the vv modifier with this operation, to request
           that aarr list each name as it extracts it.

           If  you  do  not  specify  a  _m_e_m_b_e_r, all files in the
           archive are extracted.

           Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive.

AR(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 AR(1)


       A number of modifiers (_m_o_d) may immediately follow  the  _p
       keyletter,   to   specify  variations  on  an  operation's
       behavior:

       aa   Add new files _a_f_t_e_r an existing member of the archive.
           If  you  use  the  modifier aa, the name of an existing
           archive member must be present as the _r_e_l_p_o_s argument,
           before the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.

       bb   Add  new  files  _b_e_f_o_r_e  an  existing  member  of  the
           archive.  If you use the modifier bb, the  name  of  an
           existing  archive member must be present as the _r_e_l_p_o_s
           argument, before the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.  (same  as
           ii).

       cc   _C_r_e_a_t_e  the  archive.  The specified _a_r_c_h_i_v_e is always
           created if it did  not  exist,  when  you  request  an
           update.  But a warning is issued unless you specify in
           advance that you expect to create it,  by  using  this
           modifier.

       ff   Truncate  names  in the archive.  GNU aarr will normally
           permit file names of any length.  This will  cause  it
           to  create  archives which are not compatible with the
           native aarr program on  some  systems.   If  this  is  a
           concern,  the  ff modifier may be used to truncate file
           names when putting them in the archive.

       ii   Insert new files _b_e_f_o_r_e  an  existing  member  of  the
           archive.   If  you  use the modifier ii, the name of an
           existing archive member must be present as the  _r_e_l_p_o_s
           argument,  before the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.  (same as
           bb).

       ll   This modifier is accepted but not used.

       NN   Uses the _c_o_u_n_t parameter.  This is used if  there  are
           multiple  entries  in  the archive with the same name.
           Extract or delete instance _c_o_u_n_t  of  the  given  name
           from the archive.

       oo   Preserve the _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_l dates of members when extracting
           them.  If you do  not  specify  this  modifier,  files
           extracted  from  the archive are stamped with the time
           of extraction.

       PP   Use the full path name  when  matching  names  in  the
           archive.  GNU aarr can not create an archive with a full
           path name (such archives are not POSIX complaint), but
           other  archive  creators  can.  This option will cause
           GNU aarr to match file names using a complete path name,
           which  can be convenient when extracting a single file
           from an archive created by another tool.

AR(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 AR(1)


       ss   Write an object-file index into the archive, or update
           an  existing  one,  even if no other change is made to
           the archive.  You may use this  modifier  flag  either
           with  any  operation,  or  alone.   Running aarr ss on an
           archive is equivalent to running rraannlliibb on it.

       SS   Do not generate an archive  symbol  table.   This  can
           speed  up  building  a large library in several steps.
           The resulting archive can not be used with the linker.
           In  order to build a symbol table, you must omit the SS
           modifier on the last execution of aarr, or you must  run
           rraannlliibb on the archive.

       TT   Make  the  specified  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e  a  _t_h_i_n archive.  If it
           already exists and is a regular archive, the  existing
           members  must  be  present  in  the  same directory as
           _a_r_c_h_i_v_e.

       uu   Normally, aarr rr... inserts all files  listed  into  the
           archive.   If  you  would like to insert _o_n_l_y those of
           the files  you  list  that  are  newer  than  existing
           members  of  the same names, use this modifier.  The uu
           modifier  is  allowed  only  for   the   operation   rr
           (replace).   In  particular, the combination qquu is not
           allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose  any
           speed advantage from the operation qq.

       vv   This  modifier  requests  the  _v_e_r_b_o_s_e  version  of an
           operation.    Many   operations   display   additional
           information,  such  as  filenames  processed, when the
           modifier vv is appended.

       VV   This modifier shows the version number of aarr.

       aarr  ignores  an  initial   option   spelt   --XX3322__6644,   for
       compatibility  with  AIX.   The behaviour produced by this
       option is the default for GNU aarr.  aarr does not support any
       of  the  other  --XX  options;  in  particular,  it does not
       support --XX3322 which is the default for AIX aarr.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are  inserted  in  place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be  read,  then  the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace character may be included in an  option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a  backslash)
           may  be  included  by  prefixing  the  character to be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain  additional  @_f_i_l_e  options;  any such options
           will be processed recursively.
