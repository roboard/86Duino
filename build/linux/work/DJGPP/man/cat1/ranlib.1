       rraannlliibb  generates  an  index to the contents of an archive
       and stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol
       defined  by  a  member of an archive that is a relocatable
       object file.

       You may use nnmm --ss or nnmm ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp to list this  index.

       An  archive  with  such  an index speeds up linking to the
       library and allows routines in the library  to  call  each
       other without regard to their placement in the archive.

       The  GNU rraannlliibb program is another form of GNU aarr; running
       rraannlliibb is completely equivalent to executing aarr --ss.

       --tt  Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an  archive.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the  original  @_f_i_l_e  option.
           If  _f_i_l_e  does  not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace  character  may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire  option  in  either  single  or
           double  quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included  by  prefixing  the  character  to  be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e  options;  any  such  options
           will be processed recursively.
