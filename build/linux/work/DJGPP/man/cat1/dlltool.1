       ddllllttooooll  reads  its inputs, which can come from the --dd and
       --bb options as  well  as  object  files  specified  on  the
       command  line.   It then processes these inputs and if the
       --ee option has been specified it creates  a  exports  file.
       If  the  --ll option has been specified it creates a library
       file and if the --zz option has been specified it creates  a
       def  file.  Any or all of the --ee, --ll and --zz options can be
       present in one invocation of dlltool.

       When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it
       is  necessary to have three other files.  ddllllttooooll can help
       with the creation of these files.

       The first file  is  a  _._d_e_f  file  which  specifies  which
       functions  are  exported from the DLL, which functions the
       DLL imports, and so on.  This is a text file  and  can  be
       created by hand, or ddllllttooooll can be used to create it using
       the --zz option.  In this case ddllllttooooll will scan the  object
       files  specified  on  its  command  line looking for those
       functions  which  have  been  specially  marked  as  being
       exported  and  put  entries  for  them in the _._d_e_f file it
       creates.

       In order to mark a function as being exported from a  DLL,
       it  needs  to  have an --eexxppoorrtt::<<nnaammee__ooff__ffuunnccttiioonn>> entry in
       the ..ddrreeccttvvee section of the object file.  This can be done
       in C by using the _a_s_m_(_) operator:

                 asm (".section .drectve");
                 asm (".ascii \"-export:my_func\"");

                 int my_func (void) { ... }

       The  second  file  needed  for  DLL creation is an exports
       file.  This file is linked with the object files that make
       up  the  body  of  the  DLL  and  it handles the interface
       between the DLL and the outside world.  This is  a  binary
       file  and  it  can  be  created by giving the --ee option to
       ddllllttooooll when it is creating or reading in a _._d_e_f file.

       The third file needed for DLL creation is the library file
       that  programs  will  link  with  in  order  to access the
       functions in the DLL.  This file can be created by  giving
       the --ll option to dlltool when it is creating or reading in
       a _._d_e_f file.

       ddllllttooooll builds the library file by hand, but it builds the
       exports   file  by  creating  temporary  files  containing
       assembler statements and then assembling  these.   The  --SS
       command line option can be used to specify the path to the
       assembler that dlltool will use, and the --ff option can  be
       used to pass specific flags to that assembler.  The --nn can
       be used to prevent dlltool from deleting  these  temporary
       assembler  files  when  it is done, and if --nn is specified
       twice then this will prevent  dlltool  from  deleting  the
       temporary object files it used to build the library.

       Here  is  an  example of creating a DLL from a source file
       ddllll..cc and also creating a program  (from  an  object  file
       called pprrooggrraamm..oo) that uses that DLL:

                 gcc -c dll.c
                 dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o
                 gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll
                 gcc program.o dll.lib -o program

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The command line options have the following meanings:

       --dd _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       ----iinnppuutt--ddeeff _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Specifies  the  name  of a _._d_e_f file to be read in and
           processed.

       --bb _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       ----bbaassee--ffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Specifies the name of a base file to be  read  in  and
           processed.  The contents of this file will be added to
           the relocation section in the exports  file  generated
           by dlltool.

       ----eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss
           Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the
           input  object  files as symbols to be exported.  There
           is a small list of symbols which are not  exported  by
           default;  see  the  ----nnoo--ddeeffaauulltt--eexxcclluuddeess option.  You
           may add to the list of symbols to not export by  using
           the ----eexxcclluuddee--ssyymmbboollss option.

       ----nnoo--eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss
           Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input _._d_e_f
           file or in  ..ddrreeccttvvee  sections  in  the  input  object
           files.   This  is the default behaviour.  The ..ddrreeccttvvee
           sections are created by ddlllleexxppoorrtt  attributes  in  the
           source code.

       ----eexxcclluuddee--ssyymmbboollss _l_i_s_t
           Do  not export the symbols in _l_i_s_t.  This is a list of
           symbol names separated by comma or  colon  characters.
           The   symbol   names  should  not  contain  a  leading
           underscore.    This   is    only    meaningful    when
           ----eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss is used.

       ----nnoo--ddeeffaauulltt--eexxcclluuddeess
           When  ----eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss is used, it will by default
           avoid exporting certain special symbols.  The  current
           list  of  symbols  to  avoid  exporting is DDllllMMaaiinn@@1122,
           DDllllEEnnttrryyPPooiinntt@@00,  iimmppuurree__ppttrr.    You   may   use   the
           ----nnoo--ddeeffaauulltt--eexxcclluuddeess  option  to  go ahead and export
           these special symbols.  This is only  meaningful  when
           ----eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss is used.

       --SS _p_a_t_h
       ----aass _p_a_t_h
           Specifies  the  path,  including  the filename, of the
           assembler to be used to create the exports file.

       --ff _o_p_t_i_o_n_s

           passed  to  the  assembler  when  building the exports
           file.  This option will work even if the --SS option  is
           not used.  This option only takes one argument, and if
           it occurs more than once on  the  command  line,  then
           later  occurrences  will override earlier occurrences.
           So if it is necessary to pass multiple options to  the
           assembler they should be enclosed in double quotes.

       --DD _n_a_m_e
       ----ddllll--nnaammee _n_a_m_e
           Specifies  the  name  to be stored in the _._d_e_f file as
           the name of the DLL when the --ee option  is  used.   If
           this option is not present, then the filename given to
           the --ee option will be used as the name of the DLL.

       --mm _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
       --mmaacchhiinnee _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
           Specifies the type of machine for  which  the  library
           file  should be built.  ddllllttooooll has a built in default
           type, depending upon how  it  was  created,  but  this
           option can be used to override that.  This is normally
           only useful when creating DLLs for an  ARM  processor,
           when the contents of the DLL are actually encode using
           Thumb instructions.

       --aa
       ----aadddd--iinnddiirreecctt
           Specifies that when ddllllttooooll is  creating  the  exports
           file it should add a section which allows the exported
           functions to be referenced without  using  the  import
           library.  Whatever the hell that means!

       --UU
       ----aadddd--uunnddeerrssccoorree
           Specifies  that  when  ddllllttooooll is creating the exports
           file it should prepend an underscore to the  names  of
           _a_l_l exported symbols.

       ----aadddd--ssttddccaallll--uunnddeerrssccoorree
           Specifies  that  when  ddllllttooooll is creating the exports
           file it should prepend an underscore to the  names  of
           exported  _s_t_d_c_a_l_l  functions.  Variable names and non-
           stdcall function names are not modified.  This  option
           is useful when creating GNU-compatible import libs for
           third party  DLLs  that  were  built  with  MS-Windows
           tools.

       --kk
       ----kkiillll--aatt
           Specifies  that  when  ddllllttooooll is creating the exports
           file it should  not  append  the  string  @@  <<nnuummbbeerr>>.
           These  numbers  are  called  ordinal  numbers and they
           represent another way of accessing the function  in  a
           DLL, other than by name.

       ----aadddd--ssttddccaallll--aalliiaass
           Specifies  that  when  ddllllttooooll is creating the exports

           and   library  files  it  should  omit  the  ".idata5"
           section.   This  is  for  compatibility  with  certain
           operating systems.

       --ii
       ----iinntteerrwwoorrkk
           Specifies  that ddllllttooooll should mark the objects in the
           library file and exports  file  that  it  produces  as
           supporting interworking between ARM and Thumb code.

       --nn
       ----nnooddeelleettee
           Makes  ddllllttooooll  preserve the temporary assembler files
           it used to create the exports file.  If this option is
           repeated then dlltool will also preserve the temporary
           object files it uses to create the library file.

       ----tteemmpp--pprreeffiixx _p_r_e_f_i_x
           Makes ddllllttooooll use _p_r_e_f_i_x when constructing  the  names
           of  temporary assembler and object files.  By default,
           the temp file prefix is generated from the pid.

       --vv
       ----vveerrbboossee
           Make dlltool describe what it is doing.

       --hh
       ----hheellpp
           Displays a list  of  command  line  options  and  then
           exits.

           Displays dlltool's version number and then exits.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the  original  @_f_i_l_e  option.
           If  _f_i_l_e  does  not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace  character  may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire  option  in  either  single  or
           double  quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included  by  prefixing  the  character  to  be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e  options;  any  such  options
           will be processed recursively.
