       GNU nnmm lists the symbols from object files _o_b_j_f_i_l_e....  If
       no  object  files  are listed as arguments, nnmm assumes the
       file _a_._o_u_t.

       For each symbol, nnmm shows:

       +o   The symbol value, in the  radix  selected  by  options
           (see below), or hexadecimal by default.

       +o   The  symbol  type.   At  least the following types are
           used; others are, as well,  depending  on  the  object
           file  format.   If  lowercase, the symbol is local; if
           uppercase, the symbol is global (external).

           "A" The symbol's value is absolute, and  will  not  be
               changed by further linking.

           "B"
           "b" The  symbol  is  in the uninitialized data section
               (known as BSS).

           "C" The  symbol  is  common.    Common   symbols   are
               uninitialized data.  When linking, multiple common
               symbols may appear with the  same  name.   If  the
               symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are
               treated as undefined references.

           "D"
           "d" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

           "G"
           "g" The symbol is in an initialized data  section  for
               small  objects.   Some  object file formats permit
               more efficient access to small data objects,  such
               as  a  global  int  variable as opposed to a large
               global array.

           "I" The symbol is an  indirect  reference  to  another

               symbol.   This  is  a  GNU  extension to the a.out
               object file format which is rarely used.

           "i" The  symbol  is  in  a  section  specific  to  the
               implementation of DLLs.

           "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

           "p" The symbols is in a stack unwind section.

           "R"
           "r" The symbol is in a read only data section.

           "S"
           "s" The symbol is in an uninitialized data section for
               small objects.

           "T"
           "t" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

           "U" The symbol is undefined.

           "V"
           "v" The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak  defined
               symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the
               normal defined symbol is used with no error.  When
               a  weak  undefined symbol is linked and the symbol
               is not defined,  the  value  of  the  weak  symbol
               becomes  zero  with  no  error.   On some systems,
               uppercase indicates that a default value has  been
               specified.

           "W"
           "w" The  symbol  is  a  weak  symbol that has not been
               specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.  When
               a  weak  defined  symbol  is  linked with a normal
               defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is  used
               with  no  error.   When a weak undefined symbol is
               linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of
               the  symbol  is  determined  in  a system-specific
               manner without error.  On some systems,  uppercase
               indicates that a default value has been specified.

           "-" The symbol is a stabs symbol in  an  a.out  object
               file.   In  this case, the next values printed are
               the stabs other field, the stabs desc  field,  and
               the  stab  type.   Stabs  symbols are used to hold
               debugging information.

           "?" The symbol type is unknown, or object file  format
               specific.

       +o   The symbol name.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  long  and  short  forms  of  options,  shown  here as
       alternatives, are equivalent.

       --AA
       --oo
       ----pprriinntt--ffiillee--nnaammee
           Precede each symbol by the name of the input file  (or
           archive  member)  in  which  it was found, rather than
           identifying the input file once only,  before  all  of
           its symbols.

       --aa
       ----ddeebbuugg--ssyymmss
           Display   all  symbols,  even  debugger-only  symbols;
           normally these are not listed.

       --BB  The same as ----ffoorrmmaatt==bbssdd (for compatibility  with  the
           MIPS nnmm).

       --CC
       ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==_s_t_y_l_e]]
           Decode  (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e)  low-level  symbol names into user-
           level names.  Besides removing any initial  underscore
           prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names
           readable. Different compilers have different  mangling
           styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be
           used to choose an  appropriate  demangling  style  for
           your compiler.

       ----nnoo--ddeemmaannggllee
           Do  not  demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the
           default.

       --DD
       ----ddyynnaammiicc
           Display the dynamic symbols  rather  than  the  normal
           symbols.  This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,
           such as certain types of shared libraries.

       --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t
       ----ffoorrmmaatt==_f_o_r_m_a_t
           Use the output format  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  which  can  be  "bsd",
           "sysv",  or  "posix".  The default is "bsd".  Only the
           first character of _f_o_r_m_a_t is significant;  it  can  be
           either upper or lower case.

       --gg
       ----eexxtteerrnn--oonnllyy
           Display only external symbols.

       --ll
       ----lliinnee--nnuummbbeerrss
           For  each  symbol, use debugging information to try to

           find a  filename  and  line  number.   For  a  defined
           symbol, look for the line number of the address of the
           symbol.  For an undefined symbol, look  for  the  line
           number  of  a  relocation  entry  which  refers to the
           symbol.  If line  number  information  can  be  found,
           print it after the other symbol information.

       --nn
       --vv
       ----nnuummeerriicc--ssoorrtt
           Sort  symbols  numerically  by their addresses, rather
           than alphabetically by their names.

       --pp
       ----nnoo--ssoorrtt
           Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order;  print
           them in the order encountered.

       --PP
       ----ppoorrttaabbiilliittyy
           Use  the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the
           default format.  Equivalent to --ff ppoossiixx.

       --SS
       ----pprriinntt--ssiizzee
           Print size, not the value, of defined symbols for  the
           "bsd" output format.

       --ss
       ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp
           When listing symbols from archive members, include the
           index: a mapping (stored  in  the  archive  by  aarr  or
           rraannlliibb) of which modules contain definitions for which
           names.

       --rr
       ----rreevveerrssee--ssoorrtt
           Reverse the order of  the  sort  (whether  numeric  or
           alphabetic); let the last come first.

       ----ssiizzee--ssoorrtt
           Sort  symbols  by  size.   The size is computed as the
           difference between the value of  the  symbol  and  the
           value  of  the  symbol with the next higher value.  If
           the "bsd" output format is used the size of the symbol
           is printed, rather than the value, and --SS must be used
           in order both size and value to be printed.

       ----ssppeecciiaall--ssyymmss
           Display symbols which have a  target-specific  special
           meaning.  These symbols are usually used by the target
           for some  special  processing  and  are  not  normally
           helpful  when  included  included in the normal symbol
           lists.  For example for ARM targets this option  would

           skip  the  mapping  symbols  used  to mark transitions
           between ARM code, THUMB code and data.

       ----rraaddiixx==_r_a_d_i_x
           Use _r_a_d_i_x as the radix for printing the symbol values.
           It  must  be  dd  for  decimal,  oo  for octal, or xx for
           hexadecimal.

       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify an object code format other than your system's
           default format.

       --uu
       ----uunnddeeffiinneedd--oonnllyy
           Display only undefined symbols (those external to each
           object file).

       ----ddeeffiinneedd--oonnllyy
           Display only defined symbols for each object file.

       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Show the version number of nnmm and exit.

       --XX  This option is ignored for compatibility with the  AIX
           version  of  nnmm.  It takes one parameter which must be
           the  string  3322__6644.   The  default  mode  of  AIX   nnmm
           corresponds  to  --XX  3322, which is not supported by GNU
           nnmm.

       ----hheellpp
           Show a summary of the options to nnmm and exit.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are  inserted  in  place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be  read,  then  the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace character may be included in an  option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a  backslash)
           may  be  included  by  prefixing  the  character to be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain  additional  @_f_i_l_e  options;  any such options
           will be processed recursively.
