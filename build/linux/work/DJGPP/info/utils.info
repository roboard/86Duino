`bin2h'
*******

`bin2h' allows a developer to embed a binary file into a source file,
by converting the binary data to an array of integer values.

Usage: `bin2h datafile symbol headerfile'

The resulting header file has a format like this:

     unsigned char symbol[] = {
       ... data ...
     };

`djecho'
********

This program simply echoes whatever is given to it on the command line.

      Usage: djecho [-n] [-o FILE] [-s] [-a] ARGS...

`-n'
     Do not emit the trailing newline after printing the text.

`-o FILE'
     Send output to a FILE.

`-s'
     Separate ARGS with a newline, instead of the default blank.  This
     is useful for writing several lines of output in a single
     invocation (which is faster than several separate commands).

`-a'
     Append the output to the file instead of overwriting it.  Useful
     with the `-o' option.


The purpose of this program is to be able to interact directly with
`make''s ability to pass long command lines to programs.  If you use
redirection, you aren't always able to handle long command lines
(especially since echo is normally in `command.com').  With `djecho',
you can, and you can use the `-o' option to redirect output to a file
(and use the file later as a response file) without using DOS's
redirection.

Latest versions of ported `make' do not invoke `command.com' for
redirection and `echo' commands, but `djecho' is still useful for
related tasks, e.g. for writing several lines to a file in a single
invocation.  Since `djecho' is part of the basic DJGPP development
environment, it is easy to rely on it being present when a package is
built.

`djtar'
*******

Usage: `djtar' [`-n' `changeFile'] [`-e' `dir'] [`-o' `dir']
[`-t'|`-x'] [`-i'] [`-v'] [`-p'] [`-.'|`-!.'] [`-d'|`-u'|`-b'] `tarfile'

`djtar' is a program that is designed to ease the problems related to
extracting Unix tar files on a DOS machine.  The long file names and
illegal characters make regular tar programs useless.  What `djtar'
does is make some obvious name conversions automatically and give you an
opportunity to provide alternate names for more difficult cases, where
several filenames map to the same name in the restricted 8+3 DOS
filename space.

`djtar' can read compressed tar files and decompress them on the fly.
(This can be also achieved by piping the output of `gzip' to `djtar',
but for very large archives you can run out of free disk space, because
DOS implements pipes as temporary disk files.)  `djtar' knows about all
the compression methods supported by `gzip', namely, deflation (by
`gzip'), LZW compression (by `compress'), LZH compression (as with
`compress -H' available with some versions of `compress'), or Huffman
compression (by `pack').

`djtar' can decompress `.tar' archive files compressed with `bzip2',
even if several of such `bzip2'-compressed `*.tar.bz2' or `*.tbz'
archive files have been concatenated into a single file.

`djtar' can decompress files compressed with `zip' or `pkzip' as well,
but only if the `.zip' file contains only files compressed with either
the `deflation' or `stored' (i.e., uncompressed, like with `pkzip -e0')
methods.

`djtar' can also read tar archives (compressed or otherwise) written on
a Unix machine to a diskette as a raw device (i.e., without DOS
filesystem).  To use `djtar' with such archives, specify a name of the
drive (like `A:') as a tarfile argument.

When extracting files from compressed archives, `djtar' will validate
them with whatever reduntant checks are available with the compression
format, and print diagnostic messages whenever these checks fail.  The
checks and the diagnostics are generally identical to those performed
by `gzip'.  Some of the diagnostics are only printed under the verbose
operation switched on by the `-v' switch.  Unless you use the `-i'
switch, `djtar' will refuse to create files and directories beyond the
first tar directory entry which fails the checksum test; this usually
means the file is either corrupted or not in a valid tar format.

An additional bonus of using `djtar' is that it can convert Unix-style
text files to DOS-style text files, and vice versa.  By default, it
will write all files exactly as found in the archive, but the `-u' and
`-d' options can change that.  `djtar' will always convert DOS batch
files to DOS-style text files, if they have been stored as UNIX-style
text files.  This is because `command.com' refuses to run batch files
that contain UNIX-style EOLs.

`djtar' performs a number of file name conversions in an attempt to
make the files fit into MS-DOS's restricted file names.  Any file
ending in `.info-N', where N is a number, becomes `.iN'.  Any file
ending in `.tar.gz' becomes `.tgz'.  Any file ending in `.tar.bzip2',
`.tar.bz2' or `.tar.bz' becomes `.tbz' and any file ending in `.bzip2'
becomes `.bz2'.  Any `++' string within a file name becomes `xx'.  Any
leading dots are changed to underscores (but current and parent
directories, `./' and `../' are left alone).  Any remaining multiple
dots are changed to dashes, unless the part before the dot is shorter
than 3 characters and there are more than 1 dot in the filename, in
which case the dot also becomes an underscore.  As a result, e.g.,
`.foo.a.b' becomes `_foo.a-b', and `sh.lex.c' becomes `sh_lex.c'.

While `djtar' is running, if it cannot successfully perform an
exclusive open of the given file (it will refuse to overwrite an
existing file), it will prompt you for a new name.  You may type in
either a complete path, a replacement file name (no directory part), or
just hit return (the file is skipped).

If `djtar' is called as `djtart', it behaves as if it were called with
the `-t' switch; when called as `djtarx', it behaves like `djtar -x'.
Thus you can create 2 links to `djtar.exe' which will save you some
typing.

By default, `djtar' just lists the contents of the archive(s) given as
its arguments.  If you want to extract files, you must use the `-x'
option.

*Options:*

`-x'
     By default, `djtar' just lists the contents of the archive(s)
     given as its arguments.  If you want to extract files, you must use
     this option, or call `djtar' via a link named `djtarx'.

`-t'
     This option causes `djtar' to only print the contents of the tar
     file, without actually creating any files.  All the decompression,
     CRC checks etc. are still performed; thus, this option can also be
     used to test archive integrity.  This is the default behavior of
     `djtar', unless you call it via a link named `djtarx'.

`-v'
     This option modifies the output format slightly to aid in
     debugging tar file problems.  It also causes `djtar' to emit more
     verbose warning messages and print the compression method for
     compressed archives.

`-.'
     Enable the automatic conversion of dots to underscores and dashes.
     This is the default.

`-!.'
     Disable the conversion of dots.  You get the control of file
     renaming when names of several files clash.

`-n `changeFile''
     This option allows you to specify a list of filename conversions
     ahead of time.  Thus, you can use `djtart' or `djtar -t' to list
     the files, figure out the new names with your favorite editor, and
     supply that file to `djtar'.  This way, you have the fullest
     possible control on how the extracted files will be named on your
     system.

     The format of the `changeFile' file is like this:

          dir/dir/dir/old.name.here  dir/dir/dir/newname.hre
          dir/dir/dir/old2.name.here  dir/dir/dir/newname2.hre
          dir/dir/dir.to.skip.here

     The directories must be complete, not relative.  The "old"
     directories must match the complete path in the tar file, and the
     "new" directories indicate where the file goes on the DOS disk.
     If there is no "new" directory specified, the "old" one and all
     its siblings will be not extracted.

`-d'
     Convert all text files to DOS text format on output.  This won't
     usually affect binary files, but as `djtar' detects the file type
     by looking at its first 512 bytes, a small possibility of a binary
     file rendered useless by this conversion still exists, so you're
     advised to only use this option with archives of text files.

     By default, `djtar' writes all files exactly as it finds them.

`-u'
     Convert all text files to UNIX text format on output.  This won't
     usually affect binary files, but as `djtar' detects the file type
     by looking at its first 512 bytes, a small possibility of a binary
     file rendered useless by this conversion still exists, so you're
     advised to only use this option with archives of text files.

     By default, `djtar' writes all files exactly as it finds them.

`-b'
     Write all files exactly as found in the archive, with no
     conversions of text files.  This is the default.  Files written to
     the console (when `-p' is in effect) are always written in text
     mode, so this option doesn't have any effect when used with `-p',
     unless the output of `djtar' is redirected to a file or a pipe.

`-e STRING'
     Only extract files whose full path names do *not* begin with
     STRING.  This option can be used to skip portions of archive.  If
     both this and `-o' options are specified, then this option has
     precendence.  In other ways `-e' is similar to `-o' option.

`-o STRING'
     Only extract files whose full path names begin with STRING.  This
     option can be used to extract portions of archive.  Files which
     aren't extracted will still be shown, but with a string `[ skipped
     ]' appended to their names.  When given the `-o' option, `djtar'
     actually checks if STRING is the initial substring of each
     filename, so you can specify incomplete file names, thus using
     `-o' as a poor man's wildcard facility.  You may specify multiple
     `-o' options to extract several different directories and files.

`-i'
     Attempt to unpack damaged archives.  By default, `djtar' will
     refuse to create files whose directory entries in the tar archive
     fail the checksum test, and any files beyond that point.  This
     option tells `djtar' to ignore the checksum test and proceed
     anyway.  Checksum failure usually means that the tar file is
     either corrupted or not in valid tar format, so this option is
     meant to be used either with the `-t' option, or in the rare cases
     when you _know_ for sure the tar file is valid (like if you had to
     edit it to change the filenames).

`-p'
     When given this switch, `djtar' will write the files to its
     standard output, which can be piped into another program (like a
     pager) or redirected to a file.  This option is designed to allow
     you to view or extract individual files (e.g., the `README' files)
     without having to open the entire archive, and should be used with
     an appropriate `-o filename' option.

     When this option is used, diagnostic messages will be directed to
     the standard error stream (as opposed to standard output in normal
     operation), so that they won't get mixed with the files' data.

`dtou'
******

Usage: `dtou' [`-b'] [`-h'] [`-r'] [`-s'] [`-t'] [`-v'] [`-vv'] `files'

Each file specified on the command line is converted from dos's CR/LF
text file mode to unix's NL text file mode.

All djgpp wildcards are supported.  Timestamps of the files are
preserved.

`dtou' will pass an exit status of 0 to the calling context if all the
files have been successfully processed and an exit status greater than
0 if not.  In this case, the exit status is equal to the amount of
unsuccessfully processed files.  A file has not been successfully
processed if some kind of I/O error occurred.

*Options:*

`-b'
     Creates a backup of the original file if the file has been
     modified.  `.d2u' is used as backup suffix.  On systems with LFN
     support, the backup suffix will be appended to the file name.  If
     no LFN support is available the backup suffix will overwrite the
     original file suffix.

`-h'
     Displays a help text and exits.

`-r'
     Repair mode.  This mode transforms MSDOS-style EOL (CR/LF) into
     UNIX-style EOL (LF).  It ignores Cntl-Z thus it will not truncate
     the file.  CR sequences in front of LFs are left unchanged.  This
     mode is intended for repairing files that have erroneously been
     transmited in text-mode instead of binary-mode during a FTP
     session or with Windows versions of Netscape which have the bad
     habit to transfer files with such extensions as `.gz', `.bz2',
     `.tgz' as text files.

`-s'
     Strip mode.  It transforms MSDOS-style EOL (CR/LF) into UNIX-style
     EOL (LF) and strips a CR sequence of arbitrary length from a file,
     if the sequence followed by a LF.  CR sequences that are not
     followed by a LF are left unchanged.  This mode is intended to
     repair files that have been processed with buggy ports of Unix
     software, which always blindly add a CR to a LF, even if there is
     already a CR there.

`-t'
     Timestamp.  With this option the timestamp of a modified file will
     not be preserved.  The timestamp of an unmodified file will always
     be preserved.

`-v'
     Verbose mode.  Prints a single line showing the file name and if
     file processing has been successful or not.  The only case that a
     file is considered as unsuccessfully processed is if an I/O error
     has occurred.

`-vv'
     Very verbose mode.  Prints the file name and shows the kind of
     modifications that have been done to the file.  All possible
     output looks like:

          File: foo.c
          File unchanged.
          At least one CR/LF to LF transformation occurred.
          Warning: At least one CR sequence striped from a LF.
          Warning: At least one Cntl-Z has been found. File truncated
                   at line n.
          Warning: At least one LF without a preceeding CR has been found.

     Of course, not all of the above lines will appear all together.
     The first line showing the file name will always be printed.  If
     the file has not been modified at all, then only the next line
     will be printed.  If the file has been modified an appropiate
     combination of the lines 3 to 6 will be printed, indicating what
     has been modified.  The above output is of some use, e.g.: if
     `dtou' reports a LF without a preceeding CR this will be a sure
     sign that the file is either binary or has inconsistent EOL format
     for some other reason.  If `dtou' reports that a Cntl-Z (software
     EOF) has been found, then the file will be truncated at that line
     and the rest of the file will be lost.


The program is backward compatible with previous program versions if no
options are given at all.  In this case, an occurrence of Cntl-Z will
truncate the file, MSDOS-style EOL (CR/LF) are transformed into
UNIX-style EOL (LF) and CR sequence stripping will not happen at all.
Also the timestamp will not be alterated and no backup of the original
file will be done.

`gxx'
*****

This program is exactly like `gcc' (in fact, it calls gcc), except that
it provides the extra libraries required to link most C++ programs,
including the iostreams, stdc, and libg++ libraries.


File: utils.info,  Node: redir,  Next: djsplit,  Prev: gxx,  Up: Top

`redir'
*******

DOS, in its many flavors and versions, lacks a decent I/O redirection
mechanism.  Sure, it's got < and > and >>, but what about error
messages?  Lots of people ask, "How do you send those error messages to
a file?"  Well, you use a program like `redir'.

`redir' is basically a program that manipulates the standard file
descriptors by copying them, closing and opening them, etc.  Once it
has the file descriptors where it wants them, it runs your program,
which inherits the changed descriptors.  Thus, `redir' has nearly
complete control over the input and output of your program.

It also allows you to view the exit code of the program, and the
elapsed time of the program, by supplying the appropriate options on
the command line.

Note that `redir' is built with command-line expansion and response
files disabled, so as to allow the application to control that
themselves.  This means that you can't use those features to provide
`redir''s options or the command name, but if you use them for the
command's options, the command will do the expansion if it wants to.

The exit code of `redir' is 1 if it exits on its own accord, else it
returns the same error code as the program it runs.

Usage: `redir' [`-i' FILE] [`-o' FILE] [`-oa' FILE] [`-e' FILE] [`-ea'
FILE] [`-eo'] [`-oe'] [`-x'] [`-t'] COMMAND [ARGS . . .]

`-i FILE'
     Redirect stdandard input from file

`-o FILE'
     Redirect standard output to file

`-oa FILE'
     Append standard output to file

`-e FILE'
     Redirect standard error to file

`-ea FILE'
     Append standard error to file

`-eo'
     Redirect standard error to standard output

`-oe'
     Redirect standard output to standard error

`-x'
     Print the exit code of the command after it exits.  If the exit
     code is 0..255, it is printed as is.  If it is not, the low byte
     (0..255) is printed in decimal and the whole value is also printed
     in hex.

`-t'
     Print elapsed time, either in seconds (for short runs) or
     hours:minutes:seconds.


Options are processed in the order they are encountered.  Thus, "-o foo
-eo" means "redirect output to foo, then redirect errors there also",
whereas "-eo -o foo" means "send errors to where output was going, then
move output to foo".

Examples:

To redirect errors to a file:

     redir -e errors.lst command ...

To redirect output to a file, and errors through a pipe:

     redir -eo -o prog.out command ... | pipe

`djsplit'
*********

The `djsplit' and `djmerge' programs are designed to assist in
transporting files across unreliable channels or small media (like
floppies).  `djsplit' takes a big file and splits it into up to 1000
smaller files.  `djmerge' puts them back together again.

Usage: `djsplit [-t] INPUTFILE CHUNKSIZE OUTPUTBASE'

Each output file is made from appending a sequence number to
OUTPUTBASE.  For example:

     djsplit foo.tgz 1300k footgz

would result in `footgz.000', `footgz.001', etc.

The `chunksize' parameter can be expressed as bytes (NNN),
kilobytes(NNNk) or megabytes (NNNm).  The number NNN _must_ be an
integer; for example, `1.1m' will *not* work.

By default, `djsplit' creates the output files `OUTPUTBASE.NNN' with
the same time stamp and mode bits as the original file `INPUTFILE'.
(`djmerge' will then recreate the file's time and modes as they
originally were.)  If you want the output files to have the current
time and the default attribute bits, use the `-t' switch.

For example, given `footgz.000', `footgz.001', etc,

     djmerge footgz foo.tgz

would result in `foo.tgz' being created.

By default, `djmerge' creates the output file `OUTPUTFILE' with the
same time stamp and mode bits as the first file `INPUTBASE.000'.  If
you want the output file to have the current time and the default

`texi2ps'
*********

`texi2ps' is a modified version of `makeinfo' that quickly turns
texinfo files (such as info files are generated from) into crude
Postscript files, ready for printing.  The program is designed to
produce a crude page, so please don't complain if the printed copy looks
ugly.  If you want clean pages, get and install TeX and print it with
that.  It will produce a much cleaner print.  I'm also pretty sure that
texi2ps won't support 100% of the texinfo documents out there.  Again,
if you want it right use TeX.

Note that the input files are texinfo files, not TeX or LaTeX or info
files.  In normal djgpp distributions, the texinfo files are part of
the source distributions, and the info files are in the binary
distributions.

The default settings produce a pretty densely packed page - small font,
small margins.  You can set the margins and font even smaller to save on
paper, or make them bigger for more conventional manuals.

Usage: `texi2ps' [`-f' SIZE] [`-I' DIR] [`-I'DIR] [`-v'] [`-m' PTS] FILE

`-f SIZE'
     The font size, in points.  The default is 10 points.

`-I PATH'
     Specifies an additional path to search for include files.

`-v'
     Print verbose messages about files read, nodes encountered, and
     pages generated.

`-m PTS'
     Set the margin size in points.  The default is 54 points, or 3/4
     inches (72 points = 1 inch).


Note that the Postscript file is sent to standard output, so you must
redirect the output to a file or a printer.

`update'
********

`update' is a fancy copy-if-needed program.  Basically, it compares the
two files you give it, and if they differ, copies one to the other.
This is useful in makefiles where a file is generated often, but its
contents changes rarely, and other files depend on it.  For example,
`bison' emits a header file each time it parses the grammar.  The
header rarely changes, but the grammar changes often.  So, you use
`update' to copy the header to its real name only when it changes, and
everything else won't need to be recompiled each time.

Usage: `update' NEW_FILE COPIED_TO

Example:

     foo.c foo.h : foo.y
             bison foo.y
             update y_tab.h foo.h
             update y_tab.c foo.c

Another use of `update' might be to validate (and replace if necessary)
a local copy of some master data file:

     .PHONY: foo.dat
     foo.dat:    /master/data/foo.dat
                 [ -f $@ ] && cmp -s $< $@ || cp -f $< $@ && touch $@

`update' is similar to the GNU-standard shell script `move-if-change'
that comes with some GNU packages (e.g., GCC, binutils).  The two are
_not_ functionally equivalent, however; in particular, `move-if-change'
always *removes* the source file in the process of updating the target,
whereas `update' leaves the source file intact.

If you need a portable replacement for `update', there are several
options:

   * Modify the GNU `move-if-change' script to perform a
     "copy-if-change" operation.

   * Unconditionally copy source to target:

          cp -f NEW_FILE COPIED_TO && touch COPIED_TO

   * Copy source to target only if target differs from source:

          [ -f COPIED_TO ] \
            && cmp -s NEW_FILE COPIED_TO \
            || cp -f NEW_FILE COPIED_TO \
            && touch COPIED_TO


An important feature of `update' is that COPIED_TO is created with the
current timestamp.  If you are certain that `cp' on your system is not
aliased to `cp -p' or `cp --preserve' (to preserve timestamps), then
you can omit the `&& touch COPIED_TO' bit in the above command strings.

`go32-v2'
*********

`go32-v2' is a utility which allows you to run unstubbed COFF images.

With no command-line arguments, it prints the available physical and
virtual memory, much like `go32' did in v1.x.  It can run unstubified v2
COFF images, like this:
      go32-v2 myprog

If you rename it to `go32.exe' and put on your `PATH' before the v1.x
`go32.exe', it can also run v1 COFF images, by loading the v1.x `go32'
and letting it do the job.  With this setup, you can run v2 programs
from v1.x programs, because the v1.x program will load `go32-v2' (since
it found it first on the `PATH') which knows how to run v2 images,
instead the original `go32' which cannot.

If you define the environment variable `GO32_V2_DEBUG', `go32-v2' will
provide additional debugging output when it executes.

`stubify'
*********

Usage: `stubify [-v] [-g] [-stubparams=param[,param...]] files'

`stubify' is a utility that adds a DOS exectuable stub loader to the
front of a COFF image.  The input program may be COFF or a stubbed
`.exe', and may be COFF with `.exe' extension.  The resulting file will
have `.exe' extension.

*Options:*

`-v'
     Verbose mode.  When given this switch, `stubify' prints verbose
     output on the files processed.

`-g'
     Generate mode.  When given this switch, `stubify' will create an
     image containing only the stub, which can be modified by
     `stubedit' (*note stubedit::) to point to a different existing
     program in the same directory.  This is used to simulate links, so
     `argv[0]' can be used to change program behavior or create a small
     alias to the other program.

`-stubparams=param[,param...]'
     Pass `param[ param...]' to `stubedit' to tune the stub's
     parameters.  Commas in `param[,param...]' are converted into
     spaces.  See the documentation of `stubedit' (*note stubedit::)
     for the available parameters.

`stubedit'
**********

Usage: `stubedit [-h] [-v] file.exe [field=value . . .]'

`stubedit' is a utility that allows you to modify the DOS exectuable
stub loader parameters.  These parameters allow you to set the default
stack size, real mode memory transfer buffer size, the `argv0' value,
and DPMI provider.

If `-v' is not specified and no fields are provided after the file name,
`stubedit' will enter an interactive mode which displays each field and
allow you to change the values individually.

*Options:*

`-h'
     Help mode.  When given this switch, `stubedit' prints internal
     help.

`-v'
     View mode.  When given this switch, `stubedit' will display the
     current contents of the stub parameters instead of prompting to
     modify them.

`minstack='
     Specify the minimum amount of stack space.  The value may be
     specified in bytes, KBytes (with a K suffix), or MBytes (with a M
     suffix).

`bufsize='
     Specify the size of the convential memory transfer buffer size.
     The value may be specified in bytes or KBytes (with a K suffix).
     The value must be between 2 KByte and 63 KByte.

`runfile='
     Specify the base name of the file to actually run.  This is a
     string value of 8 maximum characters, and it is only used when
     this is a stub pointing to a different image (created by `stubify
     -g').

`argv0='
     Specify the string to pass as file component of `argv[0]' (maximum
     of 16 characters).

`dpmi='
     Specify the name of the program to load to provide DPMI services
     if DPMI is not currently available (maximum of 16 characters).
     The stub will search for this file first in the directory of the
     image, then each directory in your `PATH', and finally the current
     default directory.

Usage: `dxegen outfile.dxe _symbol infile.o [infile2.o ... -lgcc -lc]'

`dxegen' is a utility which allows you to create files which contain
dynamically loadable code (DXE).  This command is retained for
compatibility purposes and is a symlink to `dxe3gen' (*note dxe3gen::).

The image must be self-contained, and it cannot reference symbols from
the main image.  As a consequence, you cannot do I/O and some other
functions directly from a DXE loaded image.

Constructors, destructors, and C++ exceptions do not work.

There is a single entry point (procedure or data block) returned.  This
can be a vector of routines you have created.

`outfile.dxe' is the name you want to contain your dynamic load code.

`_symbol' is the procedure name (or data structure) you want a pointer
to.  You must add an initial underscore for most symbols created from C.

`input.o' is created with GCC from your source.  Additional arguments
on the command line (.o and .a files; or other ld options) are passed to
ld to resolve references to build your code.

The floating point emulator code provided by DJGPP is stored in a DXE.

`dxe3gen' is a utility which allows you to create files which contain
dynamically loadable code (DXE).  DXE is used as a synonym for
`dynamically loadable executable module', also called sometimes `dynamic
modules' or simply `modules' in this document.  File names provided as
arguments should not contain special characters that require quoting or
they may not be passed properly to `ld'.

There are several ways to use DXE modules.  You may either load/unload
modules at runtime or to link with them (or rather with so-called
`import libraries') at link time (e.g. statically link with dynamic
libraries).

`dxe3gen' allows you to build either dynamic modules that don't have
unresolved symbols as well as dynamic modules that DO have unresolved
symbols (and allows you to resolve them at runtime).  If your DXE
references symbols in your main image, you must provide it the
locations for those symbols or use the `dxe3res' command.

Statically linking against dynamic libraries allows for a easy way to
introduce dynamic modules into any program.  `Static linking' means
that during linking stage of your program you link against certain
library, called a `import library' in the following, which provides all
the functions present in certain DXE module.  The symbols points to
some very small wrappers, and when you call any of those functions, the
library is automatically loaded and the call is redirected further.
Also you may load/unload the library manually by calling some special
functions called `dlload_MODNAME' and `dlunload_MODNAME' functions
(where `MODNAME' stands for the name of your dynamic module).

The `dxe3gen' tool can build these import libraries, so basically you
just take a existing DXE module and generate the corresponding import
library for this module (see the `Import libraries' section).  Then you
link against it... and voila! it works.

Static linkage against dynamic libraries has a drawback: you _CANNOT_
have exported data inside the library (at least you can't use it).
This happens because the symbols are resolved to the wrappers and not
to the actual symbols inside the module.  That is, if you have a
variable called `i' in a dynamic module, and you assign `i = 1' from
your program which is statically linked against that module, you will
actually write over the wrapper and not into the actual location where
the contents of `i' are.  If you really need to set/get values of some
variables inside a dynamic module, write a couple of set_i and get_i
*functions*.

Some modules require other modules to be already loaded when they are
hit (either via `dlopen()' or a call into their corresponding import
library).  Don't worry about that: just use the `-P' (dependency)
option of the generator.

Another way to use DXE modules is implemented through the `dlopen()'
API (*note dlopen: (libc)dlopen.).  This API closely mimics the one
found on many Unix-like systems, thus you may even build some Unix
applications that use dynamic libraries without a single change.

The dynamic loader supports initialization and finalization functions
inside dynamic libraries.  You may use the standard C/C++ way of doing
initialization/finalization, for example (C++):

     	class __init
     	{
     	  __init ()
     	  {
     	    ... initialization stuff
     	  }
     	  ~__init ()
     	  {
     	    ... finalization stuff
     	  }
     	} __dummy_object;

The above approach will work on any platform with a C++ compiler.
During program (or shared library) startup the constructor for the
`__dummy_object' is called, and during program (or shared library)
shutdown the destructor is invoked.  For plain C you will have to use
the GNU C extensions:

     	void __attribute__((constructor)) __init_func ()
     	{
     	  ... initialization stuff
     	}
     
     	void __attribute__((destructor)) __finit_func ()
     	{
     	  ... finalization stuff
     	}

Building a DXE
==============

To build a DXE module you will use the `dxe3gen' tool.

Now suppose you have some library which you want to turn into a DXE
module.  To do this inside the makefile for your library add a rule
like this:

     mylib.dxe: one.o two.o three.o four.o
     	dxe3gen -o $ $^

That is, the `dxe3gen -o mylib.dxe one.o two.o three.o four.o' will
build the `mylib.dxe' dynamically-loadable module.  All public (e.g.
non-static) symbols will be exported, and you may query the address for
any of them with the `dlsym' API function.

Now suppose you use some functions from the C library, like `strcpy',
`strlen' and so on.  In this case `dxe3gen' will list all those symbols
and will tell you that they are `unresolved', because these functions
are not present in any of the object files you have specified on the
command line.  From now on you have several ways to go:

-*- You can link the DXE module with the C library by specifying `-lc'
on the `dxe3gen' command line.  This effectively will add all the
unresolved symbols to your DXE module, taking them from the C library.
Drawbacks:

   * If your program and/or other modules use same functions, this will
     duplicate the code through all of them.

   * Many functions won't work this way because they refer to other
     symbols in other libraries such as `-lgcc', the later usually
     refers some symbols from `crt0.o' and you can't link with `crt0.o'
     (well, you can but you cannot launch crt0.o's initialization
     routine because it will screw many things up).  For example, you
     can't link against `-lc' to get the `printf' routine.  Most file
     functions and memory allocation functions are a no-no as well.

   * Sometimes it could lead to a deadly-embrace situation: suppose you
     resolve against LIBC, build an import library and then link with
     it.  If the functions you extracted from LIBC are made visible
     (exported) in the module, the corresponding import library will
     contain references to them.  Then, the linker might consider the
     symbols from your library, instead of LIBC.  Here comes the
     nastiness: until the module is loaded, all those symbols are
     nothing but wrappers to `dlopen'.  The worst case is when `dlopen'
     fires but calls such a function, which again will try to load the
     module and so on.  As a workaround, keep such names unexported by
     filtering exported names through `-E' option.


-*- The best way is to leave the symbols unresolved and resolve them at
runtime. To tell `dxe3gen' to not fail on unresolved symbols, add the
option `-U'.  This will build a DXE module with unresolved symbols.

Before loading such a module you should provide somehow the missing
symbols to the DXE loader so that it can fix up all the references to
those missing functions.  If it doesn't succeed, the loader will fail.
The easiest way to provide symbol references is using `dxe3res'.

There are several ways to provide symbol references to loader.  The
first one is to provide a explicit pointer to every function you are
going to export into dynamically-loadable modules.  You can do it with
a couple of handy macros:

     	#include <sys/dxe.h>
     
     	DXE_EXPORT_TABLE (exported_symbols)
     	  DXE_EXPORT (printf)
     	  DXE_EXPORT (strcpy)
     	  DXE_EXPORT (strcat)
     	  ...
     	DXE_EXPORT_END
     
         or:
     
     	#include <sys/dxe.h>
     
     	extern_asm(_printf);
     	extern_asm(_strcpy);
     	extern_asm(_strcat);
     	...
     	DXE_EXPORT_TABLE (exported_symbols)
     	  DXE_EXPORT_ASM (_printf)
     	  DXE_EXPORT_ASM (_strcpy)
     	  DXE_EXPORT_ASM (_strcat)
     	  ...
     	DXE_EXPORT_END

Both the above sequences are equivalent.  As you can see,
`DXE_EXPORT_ASM' macro requires its parameter to be previously declared
with "extern_asm".  Now you should pass this export table to the
dynamic linker:

     	dlregsym (exported_symbols);

The loader now knows these symbols so if any loaded module has
references to them, it knows how to resolve them.  You may call
`dlregsym' as much as you want, the symbols are accumulating in a
internal table of the dynamic loader.  Also you may unregister symbols
with `dlunregsym' function.

Another way to resolve symbols is to make all exported symbols in one
module global, thus they get added to the global symbol table and when
a new module with unresolved symbols is loaded, these shared libraries
are searched for the corresponding exported symbol. This allows you to
use symbols from one module as regular `extern's in another module.  A
simple example:

     	---------- module A
     	void something ()
     	{
     	  ...
     	}
     	---------- module B
     	extern void something ()
     	void something_else ()
     	{
     	  something ();
     	}

When you link module B, you use the `-U' switch to suppress the warning
about symbol `something' being unresolved.  Now from your program you
first load the module A:

     	dlopen ("moduleA.dxe", RTLD_GLOBAL);

then load the module B:

     	dlopen ("moduleB.dxe", 0);

The references are now resolved.  Note that during first `dlopen' call
the `RTLD_GLOBAL' flag is specifed so that all exported symbols become
visible to other modules.

The third and most powerful way is to use the `dxe3res' tool (*note
dxe3res::).  It combines the previous methods and requires minimal
interaction from the user, as the table is built automatically.  To be
more specific, dxe3res outputs a valid C source file, which must be
compiled and linked with your application:

     	dxe3res -o table.c moduleA.dxe moduleB.dxe

Also sometimes you may want to build a DXE module from a ready library.
For example, you can build DXE modules of `libjpeg.a', `libpng.a' and
`libz.a' without recompiling the libraries.  For this you should
specify a special option to the linker: `--whole-archive' (this is a
GNU `ld' option, it is just passed to `ld' by `dxe3gen'):

     	dxe3gen -o z.dxe -Y libz_i.a --whole-archive -U libz.a \
     	  -D "Zlib compression library"
     
     	dxe3gen -o png.dxe -Y libpng_i.a --whole-archive -U libpng.a \
     	  -D "Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Reference Library"
     
     	dxe3gen -o jpeg.dxe -Y libjpeg_i.a --whole-archive -U libjpeg.a \
     	  -D "The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software"

You should call all import libraries `libsomething_i.a', to avoid
confusion.

Import libraries
================

Import libraries are a special kind of libraries (`.a') which contains
a number of very small wrappers (just long jumps to the actual functions
inside the dynamic module and two functions: `dlload_MODNAME' and
`dlunload_MODNAME'.

Initially all jumps are directed to `dlload_MODNAME', thus when you
call any function from a dynamic module it initially arrives to
`dlload_MODNAME' function.  Then the module is loaded, all jumps are
directed to the respective locations inside the dynamic module, and the
last call is restarted.

As you may understand (and mentioned above), this approach does not
work with variables.  This is one of the drawbacks of this method.

To build a import library you should use the `-Y' switch on the
`dxe3gen' command line.  The import library can be built from a ready
DXE module as well as `on-the-fly' during DXE generation process.  For
example, you can do:

     	dxe3gen -Y libmy.a -o my.dxe one.o two.o three.o

as well as

     	dxe3gen -o my.dxe one.o two.o three.o
     	dxe3gen -Y libmy.a my.dxe

Both above sequences are equivalent.  The `-I' switch does the same
thing as the `-Y' option and is used if you do not want to have symbols
automatically resolved (when they are provided by another DXE, for
example).

`symify'
********

Usage: `symify [-o output.dmp] [-i input.dmp] progname.exe'

`symify' is a utility that adds procedure names and source line numbers
to the call frame traceback displayed on the screen when a program
aborts.  The default behavior is to add the extra information to the
screen, but input or output from files can be specified with the `-o'
and `-i' switches.  `symify' can only interpret debug information in
COFF format.  If `bfdsymify' is installed `symify' will pass the
arguments to `bfdsymify', which can handle additional debug formats.
`bfdsymify' is included in the `gdb' (GNU debugger) package.

The call frame traceback EIPs are displayed in hexadecimal address
values.  These values show the addresses where one procedure calls
another and has pushed its return information onto the stack.  The
values at the top are the most recently called procedures.  `symify'
reads the debug information from the executable you specify on the
command line (with `.exe' extension) and puts it after the hexadecimal
numbers.  If the image is stripped there is no additional information
which can be added.  If you compiled the modules with the `-g' switch
to `gcc' you can also display source line numbers (without `-g' you
will only get procedure names and offsets into those procedures).

*Options:*

`-o OUTPUT-FILE'
     Output to the specified file OUTPUT-FILE.  `symify' copies the
     traceback plus symbolic names and puts it into the file name you
     specify after the `-o' option.  This allows you to save it (for
     sending to the author, or examination while fixing the bug).  If
     `-o' is specified the screen buffer is not changed.

`-i INPUT-FILE'
     Input from the specified file INPUT-FILE.  `symify' reads the
     stack trace from the file name you specify after the `-i' option.
     This file could be created by `redir' (*note redir::) or
     redirecting handle 2 to a file.


Known compatibility problem (Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP):

Sometimes `symify' cannot read the screen buffer to get the traceback
information.  In that case you must copy the screen buffer manually and
save it to a file, and use the `-i' option.

`edebug32'
**********

Usage: `edebug32 debug-image.exe [args to debug-image]'

`edebug32' is a simple debugger for DJGPP images.  See the internal
help (`h' at the command prompt) for more information on usage.
`edebug32' is an expert's debugger and does not support newer debugging
formats.  `debug32' can only interpret debug information in COFF
format, which can be generated at compile time using the `-gcoff'
option to `gcc'.  It is recommended that new users try one of the other
more powerful or easy-to-use debuggers such as `gdb'.

`fsdb'
******

Usage: `fsdb [-p path] [-d] [-s setup] debug-image.exe [args]'

`fsdb' is a full screen debugger for DJGPP images.  See the internal
help (press F1 key) for more information on usage.  `fsdb' is not
actively maintained and does not support newer debugging formats.
`fsdb' can only interpret debug information in COFF format, which can
be generated at compile time using the `-gcoff' option to `gcc'.  It is
recommended that new users try one of the newer debuggers such as
`rhgdb'.

*Options:*

`-p SOURCE-PATH'
     Specify source path as SOURCE-PATH to find source files used to
     build this image.  The source path can also be set as an
     environment variable `FSDBPATH', but the command line option will
     override the environment variable.

`-d'
     Dual monitors.  Enable dual monitor display using monochrome
     graphics card.  Useful when debugging graphics images but requires
     special hardware.  Dual monitors can also be requested by setting
     the environment variable `FSDBDUAL'.

`-s SETUP-FILE'
     Specify setup file as SETUP-FILE.  The default is `fsdb.dsk' in
     the current directory.
