This is a DJGPP port of GNU Flex 2.5.4


1. To install the binary package, just unzip the file flx254b.zip
   preserving the directory structure (for PKUNZIP, use the -d
   switch) and you are all set.

   Note that the distribution comes with two symlinks to `flex.exe'
   called `flexx.exe' and `flexpp.exe'.  These make `flex' default to
   producing a C++ scanner class, exactly like the -+ command-line
   option.  (On Unix, this symlink is usually called `flex++', but
   MS-DOS doesn't allow `+' in the filename.)

2. Rebuilding from sources
   -----------------------

   You will need the following tools:

       - Gcc and the development environment (gccNNNb.zip,
	 djdevNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip);
       - Sed (sedNNNb.zip);
       - cp, rm, mv and touch from Fileutils (filNNNb.zip);
       - Bison (bsnNNNb.zip);
       - diff from Diffutils (difNNNb.zip) -- if you want to run the
	 tests after building Flex.

   Install these tools, unpack the source distribution (use -d switch
   if you do that with PKUNZIP), then type the following to build
   Flex:

		misc\msdos\configur.bat
		make

   When Make finishes, run the test:

		make check

   This should print ``Check successful, using COMPRESSION=""'';
   anything else means trouble.

   You may also run the large test suite; type "make bigcheck" and be
   prepared to wait for a while (it can take up to 20 minutes on slow
   machines).  Some of the scanners produced by Flex during the tests,
   notably when COMPRESSION is set to "-f:", include humongous tables
   which might cause CWSDPMI run out of its internal heap when cc1
   compiles the scanner.  If gcc prints "Virtual memory exhausted",
   enlarge the CWSDPMI internal heap to 256 paragraphs (using the
   CWSPARAM program) and rerun the tests.  You will also need to make
   sure your TMPDIR points to a real disk, since gcc produces
   temporary files that can easily overflow a typical RAM drive.

3. The file DIFFS in the source distribution describes the changes
   for this port, relative to the official FSF archive.
