       The  C++  and Java languages provide function overloading,
       which means that you can write  many  functions  with  the
       same  name,  providing that each function takes parameters
       of different types.  In order to be  able  to  distinguish
       these  similarly  named functions C++ and Java encode them
       into a low-level assembler name which uniquely  identifies
       each   different   version.   This  process  is  known  as
       _m_a_n_g_l_i_n_g.  The  cc++++ffiilltt  [1]  program  does  the   inverse
       mapping: it decodes (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e_s) low-level names into user-
       level names so that they can be read.

       Every alphanumeric word (consisting  of  letters,  digits,
       underscores,  dollars,  or periods) seen in the input is a
       potential mangled name.  If the name decodes  into  a  C++
       name,  the  C++  name  replaces  the low-level name in the
       output, otherwise the original word is  output.   In  this
       way   you  can  pass  an  entire  assembler  source  file,
       containing mangled names, through cc++++ffiilltt and see the same
       source file containing demangled names.

       You can also use cc++++ffiilltt to decipher individual symbols by
       passing them on the command line:

               c++filt <symbol>

       If no _s_y_m_b_o_l arguments are  given,  cc++++ffiilltt  reads  symbol
       names  from  the  standard input instead.  All the results
       are  printed  on  the  standard  output.   The  difference
       between reading names from the command line versus reading
       names  from  the  standard  input  is  that  command  line
       arguments  are  expected  to  be just mangled names and no
       checking is performed to separate  them  from  surrounding
       text.  Thus for example:

               c++filt -n _Z1fv

       will work and demangle the name to "f()" whereas:

               c++filt -n _Z1fv,

       will  not  work.   (Note the extra comma at the end of the

       mangled  name  which  makes  it  invalid).   This  command
       however will work:

               echo _Z1fv, | c++filt -n

       and will display "f(),", i.e., the demangled name followed
       by a trailing comma.  This behaviour is because  when  the
       names are read from the standard input it is expected that
       they might be part of an assembler source file where there
       might  be  extra,  extraneous  characters trailing after a
       mangled name.  For example:

                   .type   _Z1fv, @function

           On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers  put  an
           underscore in front of every name.  For example, the C
           name "foo"  gets  the  low-level  name  "_foo".   This
           option   removes   the  initial  underscore.   Whether
           cc++++ffiilltt removes the underscore by  default  is  target
           dependent.

           This is disabled by default since  mangled  types  are
           normally  only  used  internally  in the compiler, and
           they can be  confused  with  non-mangled  names.   For
           example,  a  function  called "a" treated as a mangled
           type name would be demangled to "signed char".

           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are  inserted  in  place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be  read,  then  the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace character may be included in an  option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a  backslash)
           may  be  included  by  prefixing  the  character to be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain  additional  @_f_i_l_e  options;  any such options
