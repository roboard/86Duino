       This  man  page  is an extract of the documentation of GNU
       _m_a_k_e.  It is updated only occasionally,  because  the  GNU
       project  does  not use nroff.  For complete, current docu-
       mentation, refer to the Info file mmaakkee..iinnffoo which is  made
       from the Texinfo source file mmaakkee..tteexxii.

       The  purpose of the _m_a_k_e utility is to determine automati-
       cally which pieces of a large program need  to  be  recom-
       piled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The man-
       ual describes the GNU implementation of  _m_a_k_e,  which  was
       written  by  Richard  Stallman  and Roland McGrath, and is
       currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples  show  C
       programs, since they are most common, but you can use _m_a_k_e
       with any programming language whose compiler  can  be  run
       with  a  shell  command.   In fact, _m_a_k_e is not limited to
       programs.  You can use it to describe any task where  some
       files  must  be updated automatically from others whenever
       the others change.

       To prepare to use _m_a_k_e, you must write a file  called  the
       _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  that  describes the relationships among files in
       your program, and the states  the  commands  for  updating
       each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is
       updated from object files, which are in turn made by  com-
       piling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some
       source files, this simple shell command:

              mmaakkee

       suffices to perform  all  necessary  recompilations.   The
       _m_a_k_e program uses the makefile data base and the last-mod-
       ification times of the files to decide which of the  files
       need  to  be  updated.  For each of those files, it issues
       the commands recorded in the data base.

       _m_a_k_e executes commands in the _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e to  update  one  or
       more  target _n_a_m_e_s, where _n_a_m_e is typically a program.  If
       no --ff option is present, _m_a_k_e will look for the  makefiles
       _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, and _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, in that order.

       Normally  you should call your makefile either _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e or
       _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e.   (We  recommend  _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  because  it  appears
       prominently  near  the  beginning  of a directory listing,
       right near other important files  such  as  _R_E_A_D_M_E.)   The

       first  name  checked,  _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, is not recommended for
       most makefiles.  You should use this name if  you  have  a
       makefile  that  is  specific  to GNU _m_a_k_e, and will not be
       understood by other versions of _m_a_k_e.  If _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e is `-',
       the standard input is read.

       _m_a_k_e  updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files
       that have been modified since the target  was  last  modi-
       fied, or if the target does not exist.

            These  options  are  ignored  for  compatibility with
            other versions of _m_a_k_e.

       --BB, ----aallwwaayyss--mmaakkee
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       --CC _d_i_r, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy=_d_i_r
            Change to directory _d_i_r before reading the  makefiles
            or  doing  anything else.  If multiple --CC options are
            specified, each is interpreted relative to the previ-
            ous  one: --CC / --CC etc is equivalent to --CC /etc.  This
            is typically used with recursive invocations of _m_a_k_e.

       --dd   Print  debugging  information  in  addition to normal
            processing.  The  debugging  information  says  which
            files  are being considered for remaking, which file-
            times are being compared and with what results, which
            files  actually  need  to  be  remade, which implicit
            rules are considered and which  are  applied---every-
            thing  interesting about how _m_a_k_e decides what to do.

       ----ddeebbuugg_[_=_F_L_A_G_S_]
            Print debugging information  in  addition  to  normal
            processing.   If  the  _F_L_A_G_S  are  omitted,  then the
            behavior is the same as if --dd was  specified.   _F_L_A_G_S
            may be _a for all debugging output (same as using --dd),
            _b for basic  debugging,  _v  for  more  verbose  basic
            debugging,  _i  for  showing  implicit  rules,  _j  for
            details on invocation of commands, and _m  for  debug-
            ging while remaking makefiles.

       --ee, ----eennvviirroonnmmeenntt--oovveerrrriiddeess

            over variables from makefiles.

       --ii, ----iiggnnoorree--eerrrroorrss
            Ignore all errors  in  commands  executed  to  remake

       --II _d_i_r, ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr=_d_i_r
            Specifies  a  directory  _d_i_r  to  search for included
            makefiles.  If several --II options are used to specify
            several  directories, the directories are searched in
            the order specified.  Unlike the arguments  to  other
            flags  of  _m_a_k_e,  directories given with --II flags may
            come directly after the flag: --II_d_i_r  is  allowed,  as
            well  as --II _d_i_r_.  This syntax is allowed for compati-
            bility with the C preprocessor's --II flag.

       --jj [_j_o_b_s], ----jjoobbss[=_j_o_b_s]
            Specifies the number of _j_o_b_s (commands) to run simul-
            taneously.   If there is more than one --jj option, the
            last one is effective.  If the  --jj  option  is  given
            without  an  argument, _m_a_k_e will not limit the number
            of jobs that can run simultaneously.

       --kk, ----kkeeeepp--ggooiinngg
            Continue as much as possible after an  error.   While
            the  target that failed, and those that depend on it,
            cannot be remade, the  other  dependencies  of  these
            targets can be processed all the same.

       --ll [_l_o_a_d], ----llooaadd--aavveerraaggee[=_l_o_a_d]
            Specifies  that  no  new  jobs  (commands)  should be
            started if there are others jobs running and the load
            average  is  at least _l_o_a_d (a floating-point number).
            With no argument, removes a previous load limit.

       --LL, ----cchheecckk--ssyymmlliinnkk--ttiimmeess
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

            Print the commands that would be executed, but do not
            execute them.

       --oo _f_i_l_e, ----oolldd--ffiillee=_f_i_l_e, ----aassssuummee--oolldd=_f_i_l_e
            Do  not remake the file _f_i_l_e even if it is older than
            its dependencies,  and  do  not  remake  anything  on
            account  of changes in _f_i_l_e.  Essentially the file is
            treated as very old and its rules are ignored.

       --pp, ----pprriinntt--ddaattaa--bbaassee
            Print the data base (rules and variable values)  that
            results  from  reading the makefiles; then execute as
            usual or as otherwise specified.   This  also  prints
            the  version  information given by the --vv switch (see
            below).  To print the data  base  without  trying  to
            remake any files, use mmaakkee --pp --ff_/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l_.

       --qq, ----qquueessttiioonn
            ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print
            anything; just return an exit status that is zero  if
            the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero

       --rr, ----nnoo--bbuuiillttiinn--rruulleess
            Eliminate use of the built-in implicit  rules.   Also

       --RR, ----nnoo--bbuuiillttiinn--vvaarriiaabblleess

       --ss, ----ssiilleenntt, ----qquuiieett
            Silent operation; do not print the commands  as  they

       --SS, ----nnoo--kkeeeepp--ggooiinngg, ----ssttoopp
            Cancel  the  effect  of the --kk option.  This is never
            necessary except in a recursive _m_a_k_e where  --kk  might
            be inherited from the top-level _m_a_k_e via MAKEFLAGS or
            if you set --kk in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.

       --tt, ----ttoouucchh
            Touch files (mark them  up  to  date  without  really
            changing  them)  instead  of  running their commands.
            This is used to pretend that the commands were  done,
            in order to fool future invocations of _m_a_k_e.

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
            Print  the  version  of the _m_a_k_e program plus a copy-
            right, a list of authors and a notice that  there  is
            no warranty.

       --ww, ----pprriinntt--ddiirreeccttoorryy
            Print  a  message  containing  the  working directory
            before and after other processing.  This may be  use-
            ful  for  tracking down errors from complicated nests
            of recursive _m_a_k_e commands.

       ----nnoo--pprriinntt--ddiirreeccttoorryy

       ----aassssuummee--nneeww=_f_i_l_e
            Pretend  that the target _f_i_l_e has just been modified.
            When used with the --nn flag, this shows you what would
            happen  if you were to modify that file.  Without --nn,
            it is almost the same as running a _t_o_u_c_h  command  on
            the  given  file before running _m_a_k_e, except that the
            modification time is changed only in the  imagination
            of _m_a_k_e.
