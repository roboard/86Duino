       lldd   combines  a  number  of  object  and  archive  files,
       relocates  their  data  and  ties  up  symbol  references.
       Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run lldd.

       lldd accepts Linker Command  Language  files  written  in  a
       superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to
       provide  explicit  and  total  control  over  the  linking
       process.

       This  man page does not describe the command language; see
       the lldd entry in "info" for full  details  on  the  command
       language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.

       This  version of lldd uses the general purpose BFD libraries
       to operate on  object  files.  This  allows  lldd  to  read,
       combine,   and   write  object  files  in  many  different
       formats---for example, COFF or "a.out".  Different formats
       may  be  linked  together to produce any available kind of
       object file.

       Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful
       than  other  linkers  in providing diagnostic information.
       Many   linkers   abandon   execution   immediately    upon
       encountering  an  error;  whenever  possible, lldd continues
       executing, allowing you to identify other errors  (or,  in
       some  cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).

       The GNU linker lldd is meant  to  cover  a  broad  range  of
       situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other
       linkers.  As a result, you have many  choices  to  control
       its behavior.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  linker  supports  a plethora of command-line options,
       but in actual  practice  few  of  them  are  used  in  any
       particular context.  For instance, a frequent use of lldd is
       to  link  standard  Unix  object  files  on  a   standard,
       supported  Unix  system.  On such a system, to link a file
       "hello.o":

               ld -o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc

       This tells lldd to produce  a  file  called  _o_u_t_p_u_t  as  the
       result  of  linking  the file "/lib/crt0.o" with "hello.o"
       and  the  library  "libc.a",  which  will  come  from  the
       standard  search  directories.  (See the discussion of the
       --ll option below.)



binutils-2.18.90            2008-09-10                          1





LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       Some of the command-line options to lldd may be specified at
       any  point  in  the  command line.  However, options which
       refer to files, such as --ll or --TT, cause  the  file  to  be
       read  at  the  point  at  which  the option appears in the
       command line, relative to the object files and other  file
       options.   Repeating  non-file  options  with  a different
       argument will either have no further effect,  or  override
       prior  occurrences  (those  further  to  the  left  on the
       command line)  of  that  option.   Options  which  may  be
       meaningfully  specified  more  than  once are noted in the
       descriptions below.

       Non-option arguments are object files  or  archives  which
       are  to  be linked together.  They may follow, precede, or
       be mixed in with  command-line  options,  except  that  an
       object  file  argument may not be placed between an option
       and its argument.

       Usually the linker is invoked with  at  least  one  object
       file,  but  you  can  specify  other forms of binary input
       files using --ll, --RR, and the script command  language.   If
       _n_o  binary  input  files  at all are specified, the linker
       does not produce any output, and  issues  the  message  NNoo
       iinnppuutt ffiilleess.

       If  the  linker  cannot  recognize the format of an object
       file, it will assume that it is a linker script.  A script
       specified in this way augments the main linker script used
       for the link (either the default linker script or the  one
       specified  by  using --TT).  This feature permits the linker
       to link against a file which appears to be an object or an
       archive,  but  actually merely defines some symbol values,
       or  uses  "INPUT"  or  "GROUP"  to  load  other   objects.
       Specifying  a  script in this way merely augments the main
       linker script, with the extra commands  placed  after  the
       main  script;  use  the  --TT  option to replace the default
       linker  script  entirely,  but  note  the  effect  of  the
       "INSERT" command.

       For  options  whose  names  are  a  single  letter, option
       arguments must either follow  the  option  letter  without
       intervening  whitespace, or be given as separate arguments
       immediately following the option that requires them.

       For options whose names are multiple letters,  either  one
       dash  or  two  can  precede  the option name; for example,
       --ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll   and   ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll    are    equivalent.
       Note---there  is  one  exception  to  this rule.  Multiple
       letter options that start with a lower case 'o'  can  only
       be  preceded  by  two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion
       with the --oo option.   So  for  example  --oommaaggiicc  sets  the
       output file name to mmaaggiicc whereas ----oommaaggiicc sets the NMAGIC
       flag on the output.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       Arguments  to  multiple-letter  options  must  either   be
       separated  from  the  option name by an equals sign, or be
       given as  separate  arguments  immediately  following  the
       option  that  requires  them.  For example, ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll
       ffoooo  and  ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll==ffoooo   are   equivalent.    Unique
       abbreviations  of the names of multiple-letter options are
       accepted.

       Note---if the linker is being invoked  indirectly,  via  a
       compiler  driver  (e.g.  ggcccc)  then all the linker command
       line options should be prefixed by --WWll,,  (or  whatever  is
       appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:

                 gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup

       This is important, because otherwise the  compiler  driver
       program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in
       a bad link.

       Here is a table  of  the  generic  command  line  switches
       accepted by the GNU linker:

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the  original  @_f_i_l_e  option.
           If  _f_i_l_e  does  not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace  character  may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire  option  in  either  single  or
           double  quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included  by  prefixing  the  character  to  be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e  options;  any  such  options
           will be processed recursively.

       --aa_k_e_y_w_o_r_d
           This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The
           _k_e_y_w_o_r_d argument must be one of the  strings  aarrcchhiivvee,
           sshhaarreedd,   or   ddeeffaauulltt.    --aaaarrcchhiivvee  is  functionally
           equivalent to --BBssttaattiicc, and the other two keywords are
           functionally equivalent to --BBddyynnaammiicc.  This option may
           be used any number of times.

       --AA_a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e
       ----aarrcchhiitteeccttuurree==_a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e
           In the current release of lldd, this  option  is  useful
           only  for  the  Intel 960 family of architectures.  In
           that  lldd  configuration,  the  _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e   argument
           identifies  the  particular  architecture  in  the 960
           family, enabling some  safeguards  and  modifying  the
           archive-library search path.

           Future    releases   of   lldd   may   support   similar
           functionality for other architecture families.

       --bb _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
       ----ffoorrmmaatt==_i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
           lldd may be configured to support more than one kind  of
           object  file.   If your lldd is configured this way, you
           can use the --bb option to specify the binary format for
           input  object  files  that  follow  this option on the
           command line.  Even when lldd is configured  to  support
           alternative  object formats, you don't usually need to
           specify this, as lldd should be configured to expect  as
           a  default  input format the most usual format on each
           machine.  _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t is a text string, the name of a
           particular  format  supported  by  the  BFD libraries.
           (You  can  list  the  available  binary  formats  with
           oobbjjdduummpp --ii.)

           You  may  want  to  use this option if you are linking
           files with an unusual binary format.  You can also use
           --bb  to  switch formats explicitly (when linking object
           files of different formats), by  including  --bb  _i_n_p_u_t_-
           _f_o_r_m_a_t   before  each  group  of  object  files  in  a
           particular format.

           The default  format  is  taken  from  the  environment
           variable "GNUTARGET".

           You  can  also  define the input format from a script,
           using the command "TARGET";

       --cc _M_R_I_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e
       ----mmrrii--ssccrriipptt==_M_R_I_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e
           For compatibility with linkers  produced  by  MRI,  lldd
           accepts   script   files   written  in  an  alternate,
           restricted command  language,  described  in  the  MRI
           Compatible    Script   Files   section   of   GNU   ld
           documentation.  Introduce MRI script  files  with  the
           option  --cc;  use  the  --TT option to run linker scripts
           written in the general-purpose lldd scripting  language.
           If  _M_R_I_-_c_m_d_f_i_l_e does not exist, lldd looks for it in the
           directories specified by any --LL options.

       --dd
       --ddcc
       --ddpp These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are
           supported  for compatibility with other linkers.  They
           assign space to common symbols even if  a  relocatable
           output  file  is  specified  (with  --rr).   The  script
           command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

       --ee _e_n_t_r_y

           execution of your program,  rather  than  the  default
           entry  point.   If there is no symbol named _e_n_t_r_y, the
           linker will try to parse _e_n_t_r_y as a  number,  and  use
           that   as  the  entry  address  (the  number  will  be
           interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading  00xx  for
           base 16, or a leading 00 for base 8).

           Specifies  a  list  of  archive  libraries  from which
           symbols should  not  be  automatically  exported.  The
           library  names  may  be delimited by commas or colons.
           Specifying "--exclude-libs ALL"  excludes  symbols  in
           all  archive  libraries  from  automatic export.  This
           option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port
           of  the  linker  and for ELF targeted ports.  For i386
           PE, symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still
           exported, regardless of this option.  For ELF targeted
           ports, symbols affected by this option will be treated
           as hidden.

       --EE
       ----eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc
           When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all
           symbols to the  dynamic  symbol  table.   The  dynamic
           symbol  table  is the set of symbols which are visible
           from dynamic objects at run time.

           If you do not use  this  option,  the  dynamic  symbol
           table  will  normally contain only those symbols which
           are referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the
           link.

           If  you  use  "dlopen"  to load a dynamic object which
           needs to refer back to  the  symbols  defined  by  the
           program,  rather  than some other dynamic object, then
           you will probably need to use this option when linking
           the program itself.

           You  can  also  use  the  dynamic list to control what
           symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if
           the output format supports it.  See the description of
           ----ddyynnaammiicc--lliisstt.

       --EEBB Link big-endian objects.   This  affects  the  default

           output format.

           When creating an ELF shared object, set  the  internal
           DT_AUXILIARY  field to the specified name.  This tells
           the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           object  should  be  used as an auxiliary filter on the
           symbol table of the shared object _n_a_m_e.

           If you  later  link  a  program  against  this  filter
           object,  then,  when  you run the program, the dynamic
           linker  will  see  the  DT_AUXILIARY  field.   If  the
           dynamic  linker  resolves  any symbols from the filter
           object,  it  will  first  check  whether  there  is  a
           definition  in  the  shared  object _n_a_m_e.  If there is
           one, it will be used instead of the definition in  the
           filter object.  The shared object _n_a_m_e need not exist.
           Thus the shared object _n_a_m_e may be used to provide  an
           alternative   implementation   of  certain  functions,
           perhaps  for  debugging  or   for   machine   specific
           performance.

           This  option  may  be  specified  more than once.  The
           DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in the  order  in
           which they appear on the command line.

       ----ffiilltteerr _n_a_m_e
           When  creating  an ELF shared object, set the internal
           DT_FILTER field to the specified name.  This tells the
           dynamic  linker  that  the  symbol table of the shared
           object which is being created  should  be  used  as  a
           filter  on the symbol table of the shared object _n_a_m_e.

           If you  later  link  a  program  against  this  filter
           object,  then,  when  you run the program, the dynamic
           linker will see  the  DT_FILTER  field.   The  dynamic
           linker  will  resolve  symbols according to the symbol
           table of the filter  object  as  usual,  but  it  will
           actually  link  to the definitions found in the shared
           object _n_a_m_e.  Thus the filter object can  be  used  to
           select  a subset of the symbols provided by the object
           _n_a_m_e.

           Some older linkers used the  --FF  option  throughout  a
           compilation   toolchain   for  specifying  object-file
           format for both input and output  object  files.   The
           GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
           --bb, ----ffoorrmmaatt, ----ooffoorrmmaatt options, the "TARGET"  command
           in  linker  scripts,  and  the "GNUTARGET" environment
           variable.  The GNU linker will ignore  the  --FF  option
           when not creating an ELF shared object.

       --ffiinnii _n_a_m_e
           When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call
           NAME when the executable or shared object is unloaded,
           by setting DT_FINI to the address of the function.  By
           default, the linker uses "_fini" as  the  function  to
           call.

           Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized  using
           the  GP register to _s_i_z_e.  This is only meaningful for
           object file formats such as MIPS ECOFF which  supports
           putting   large   and  small  objects  into  different
           sections.  This  is  ignored  for  other  object  file
           formats.

           When  creating  an ELF shared object, set the internal
           DT_SONAME  field  to  the  specified  name.   When  an
           executable  is linked with a shared object which has a
           DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is  run  the
           dynamic  linker will attempt to load the shared object
           specified by the DT_SONAME field rather than the using
           the file name given to the linker.

       --ii  Perform an incremental link (same as option --rr).

       --iinniitt _n_a_m_e
           When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call
           NAME when the executable or shared object  is  loaded,
           by setting DT_INIT to the address of the function.  By
           default, the linker uses "_init" as  the  function  to
           call.

       ----lliibbrraarryy==_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c
           Add  the  archive or object file specified by _n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c
           to the list of files to link.  This option may be used
           any  number  of  times.   If  _n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c  is of the form
           _:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, lldd will search the library path for a  file
           called  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,  otherise it will search the library
           path for a file called _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.

           On systems which support shared libraries, lldd may also
           search    for    files   other   than   _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.
           Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems, lldd will search
           a directory for a library called _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._s_o before
           searching   for   one   called   _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.    (By
           convention,  a  ".so"  extension  indicates  a  shared
           library.)  Note that this behavior does not  apply  to
           _:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,   which  always  specifies  a  file  called
           _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

           The linker will search an archive only  once,  at  the
           location  where  it  is specified on the command line.
           If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in
           some  object  which appeared before the archive on the
           command line, the linker will include the  appropriate

           file(s)  from  the  archive.   However,  an  undefined
           symbol in an object appearing  later  on  the  command
           line  will  not cause the linker to search the archive
           again.

           See the --(( option for a way to  force  the  linker  to
           search archives multiple times.

           You  may  list  the same archive multiple times on the
           command line.

           This type of archive searching is  standard  for  Unix
           linkers.   However,  if  you are using lldd on AIX, note
           that it is different from the  behaviour  of  the  AIX
           linker.

       --LL_s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r

           Add  path  _s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r to the list of paths that lldd will
           search for archive libraries and lldd  control  scripts.
           You  may  use  this  option  any number of times.  The
           directories are searched in the order  in  which  they
           are   specified  on  the  command  line.   Directories
           specified on the command line are searched before  the
           default  directories.   All --LL options apply to all --ll
           options, regardless of the order in which the  options
           appear.

           If  _s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r  begins  with  "=", then the "=" will be
           replaced by the _s_y_s_r_o_o_t _p_r_e_f_i_x, a path specified  when
           the linker is configured.

           The  default  set  of  paths  searched  (without being
           specified with --LL) depends on which emulation mode  lldd
           is  using,  and  in  some  cases  also  on  how it was
           configured.

           The paths can also be specified in a link script  with
           the  "SEARCH_DIR" command.  Directories specified this
           way are searched at the  point  in  which  the  linker
           script appears in the command line.

       --mm_e_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n
           Emulate  the  _e_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n  linker.   You  can  list  the
           available emulations with the ----vveerrbboossee or --VV options.

           If  the  --mm option is not used, the emulation is taken
           from the "LDEMULATION" environment variable,  if  that
           is defined.

           Otherwise,  the default emulation depends upon how the
           linker was configured.

       ----pprriinntt--mmaapp
           Print a link map to the standard output.  A  link  map
           provides  information  about  the  link, including the
           following:

           *   Where object files are mapped into memory.

           *   How common symbols are allocated.

           *   All archive members included in the link,  with  a
               mention  of  the  symbol  which caused the archive
               member to be brought in.

           *   The values assigned to symbols.

               Note - symbols whose values  are  computed  by  an
               expression   which   involves  a  reference  to  a
               previous value of the same  symbol  may  not  have
               correct result displayed in the link map.  This is
               because the linker discards  intermediate  results
               and only retains the final value of an expression.
               Under such circumstances the linker  will  display
               the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus
               for example a linker script containing:

                          foo = 1
                          foo = foo * 4
                          foo = foo + 8

               will produce the following output in the link  map
               if the --MM option is used:

                          0x00000001                foo = 0x1
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo + 0x8)

       --NN
       ----oommaaggiicc
           Set  the  text  and  data  sections to be readable and
           writable.  Also, do not page-align the  data  segment,
           and  disable linking against shared libraries.  If the
           output format supports Unix style magic numbers,  mark
           the output as "OMAGIC". Note: Although a writable text
           section is allowed for PE-COFF targets,  it  does  not
           conform  to  the  format  specification  published  by
           Microsoft.

       ----nnoo--oommaaggiicc
           This option negates most of  the  effects  of  the  --NN
           option.  It sets the text section to be read-only, and
           forces the data segment to be  page-aligned.   Note  -
           this  option  does  not  enable linking against shared
           libraries.  Use --BBddyynnaammiicc for this.

       ----oouuttppuutt==_o_u_t_p_u_t
           Use _o_u_t_p_u_t as the name for the program produced by lldd;
           if  this  option  is  not specified, the name _a_._o_u_t is
           used by default.  The script command "OUTPUT" can also
           specify the output file name.

       --OO _l_e_v_e_l
           If  _l_e_v_e_l  is  a  numeric  values greater than zero lldd
           optimizes the output.  This might  take  significantly
           longer  and  therefore probably should only be enabled
           for the final binary.  At the moment this option  only
           affects   ELF   shared   library  generation.   Future
           releases of the linker  may  make  more  use  of  this
           option.   Also currently there is no difference in the
           linker's behaviour for different  non-zero  values  of
           this  option.   Again  this  may  change  with  future
           releases.

       --qq
       ----eemmiitt--rreellooccss
           Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked
           executables.   Post  link  analysis  and  optimization
           tools may need this information in  order  to  perform
           correct modifications of executables.  This results in
           larger executables.

           This  option  is  currently  only  supported  on   ELF
           platforms.

       ----ffoorrccee--ddyynnaammiicc
           Force  the output file to have dynamic sections.  This
           option is specific to VxWorks targets.

       --rr
       ----rreellooccaattaabbllee
           Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output
           file  that  can in turn serve as input to lldd.  This is
           often called _p_a_r_t_i_a_l _l_i_n_k_i_n_g.  As a  side  effect,  in
           environments that support standard Unix magic numbers,
           this option also sets the output file's  magic  number
           to  "OMAGIC".   If  this  option  is not specified, an
           absolute file is produced.  When linking C++ programs,
           this   option   _w_i_l_l   _n_o_t   resolve   references   to
           constructors; to do that, use --UUrr.

           the  output file, partial linking is only supported if
           that input file  does  not  contain  any  relocations.
           Different    output    formats    can   have   further
           restrictions; for example some  "a.out"-based  formats
           do  not  support  partial  linking with input files in
           other formats at all.

           This option does the same thing as --ii.

       --RR _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

           Read symbol names and their addresses  from  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
           but  do  not  relocate it or include it in the output.
           This allows your output file to refer symbolically  to
           absolute   locations   of   memory  defined  in  other
           programs.  You may use this option more than once.

           For compatibility with other ELF linkers,  if  the  --RR
           option  is followed by a directory name, rather than a
           file name, it is treated as the --rrppaatthh option.

       --ss

           from the output file.

       --tt
       ----ttrraaccee

           Use _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e as  the  linker  script.   This  script
           replaces  lldd's  default  linker  script  (rather  than
           adding to it), so _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e must specify  everything
           necessary   to   describe   the   output  file.     If
           _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e does not exist in  the  current  directory,
           "ld"  looks for it in the directories specified by any
           preceding --LL options.  Multiple --TT options accumulate.

           This  option  is similar to the ----ssccrriipptt option except
           that processing of the script is delayed  until  after
           the rest of the command line has been processed.  This
           allows  options  placed  after  the   ----ddeeffaauulltt--ssccrriipptt

           the linker script, which can  be  important  when  the
           linker  command  line cannot be directly controlled by
           the user.  (eg  because  the  command  line  is  being
           constructed by another tool, such as ggcccc).

       --uu _s_y_m_b_o_l
       ----uunnddeeffiinneedd==_s_y_m_b_o_l
           Force  _s_y_m_b_o_l  to  be entered in the output file as an
           undefined  symbol.   Doing  this  may,  for   example,
           trigger  linking  of  additional modules from standard
           libraries.  --uu may be repeated with  different  option
           arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
           option is equivalent to  the  "EXTERN"  linker  script
           command.

       --UUrr For  anything  other than C++ programs, this option is
           equivalent   to   --rr:   it    generates    relocatable
           output---i.e.,  an  output file that can in turn serve
           as input to lldd.  When linking C++ programs,  --UUrr  _d_o_e_s
           resolve  references  to  constructors,  unlike --rr.  It
           does not work to use --UUrr on files that were themselves
           linked  with  --UUrr; once the constructor table has been
           built, it cannot be added to.  Use --UUrr  only  for  the
           last partial link, and --rr for the others.

       ----uunniiqquuee[[==_S_E_C_T_I_O_N]]
           Creates  a  separate  output  section  for every input
           section matching _S_E_C_T_I_O_N, or if the optional  wildcard
           _S_E_C_T_I_O_N  argument  is  missing, for every orphan input
           section.  An orphan section is  one  not  specifically
           mentioned in a linker script.  You may use this option
           multiple times on the command line;  It  prevents  the
           normal  merging  of input sections with the same name,
           overriding output  section  assignments  in  a  linker
           script.

       --vv
       ----vveerrssiioonn
       --VV  Display the version number for lldd.  The --VV option also
           lists the supported emulations.

       --xx

       --XX
       ----ddiissccaarrdd--llooccaallss
           Delete all temporary local  symbols.   (These  symbols
           start   with  system-specific  local  label  prefixes,
           typically ..LL for ELF  systems  or  LL  for  traditional
           a.out systems.)

           appears.  This option  may  be  given  any  number  of
           times.   On many systems it is necessary to prepend an
           underscore.

           This option is  useful  when  you  have  an  undefined
           symbol in your link but don't know where the reference
           is coming from.

           iinniittffiirrsstt
               This option is only  meaningful  when  building  a
               shared  object.   It  marks the object so that its
               runtime  initialization  will  occur  before   the
               runtime   initialization   of  any  other  objects
               brought  into  the  process  at  the  same   time.
               Similarly  the  runtime finalization of the object
               will occur after the runtime finalization  of  any
               other objects.

           iinntteerrppoossee
               Marks  the object that its symbol table interposes
               before all symbols but the primary executable.

           llaazzyy
               When generating an executable or  shared  library,

               function call resolution to  the  point  when  the
               function  is called (lazy binding), rather than at
               load time.  Lazy binding is the default.

           llooaaddffllttrr

               Marks  the object that the search for dependencies
               of this object will  ignore  any  default  library
               search paths.

           nnooddeelleettee

           nnooww When generating an executable or  shared  library,
               mark  it to tell the dynamic linker to resolve all
               symbols when the program is started, or  when  the
               shared  library is linked to using dlopen, instead
               of deferring function call resolution to the point
               when the function is first called.

           oorriiggiinn
               Marks the object may contain $ORIGIN.

           The  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_s should be a list of archive files.  They
           may be either explicit file names, or --ll options.

           The specified archives are searched  repeatedly  until
           no new undefined references are created.  Normally, an
           archive is searched only once in the order that it  is
           specified  on  the  command line.  If a symbol in that
           archive is  needed  to  resolve  an  undefined  symbol
           referred  to  by  an object in an archive that appears
           later on the command line, the  linker  would  not  be
           able  to  resolve  that  reference.   By  grouping the
           archives, they all be searched  repeatedly  until  all
           possible references are resolved.

           Using  this option has a significant performance cost.
           It is best to use it only when there  are  unavoidable
           circular references between two or more archives.

           Tells   the   linker   to  accept  input  files  whose
           architecture cannot be recognised.  The assumption  is
           that   the   user   knows  what  they  are  doing  and
           deliberately wants to  link  in  these  unknown  input
           files.   This was the default behaviour of the linker,
           before  release  2.14.   The  default  behaviour  from
           release  2.14  onwards  is to reject such input files,
           and so the ----aacccceepptt--uunnkknnoowwnn--iinnppuutt--aarrcchh option has been

           This  option  affects  ELF  DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic
           libraries mentioned on  the  command  line  after  the
           ----aass--nneeeeddeedd  option.   Normally, the linker will add a
           DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic  library  mentioned  on
           the command line, regardless of whether the library is
           actually needed.  ----aass--nneeeeddeedd causes DT_NEEDED tags to
           only be emitted for libraries that satisfy some symbol
           reference from regular objects which is  undefined  at
           the point that the library was linked.  ----nnoo--aass--nneeeeddeedd

           This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries
           from ELF DT_NEEDED tags in dynamic libraries mentioned
           on the command line after the ----nnoo--aadddd--nneeeeddeedd  option.
           Normally, the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for each
           dynamic library from DT_NEEDED tags.   ----nnoo--aadddd--nneeeeddeedd
           causes  DT_NEEDED tags will never be emitted for those

           Specify the name of a dynamic list file to the linker.
           This is typically used when creating shared  libraries
           to  specify  a list of global symbols whose references
           shouldn't be bound to the definition within the shared
           library, or creating dynamically linked executables to
           specify a list of symbols which should be added to the
           symbol  table  in the executable.  This option is only
           meaningful  on  ELF  platforms  which  support  shared
           libraries.

           The  format  of  the  dynamic  list is the same as the
           version node without scope and node name.  See VVEERRSSIIOONN

           Provide  the builtin dynamic list for C++ operator new
           and delete.  It is mainly useful for  building  shared
           libstdc++.

       ----nnoo--cchheecckk--sseeccttiioonnss
           Asks the linker _n_o_t to check section  addresses  after
           they  have  been  assigned  to  see  if  there are any
           overlaps.   Normally  the  linker  will  perform  this
           check,  and  if  it finds any overlaps it will produce
           suitable error messages.  The linker does know  about,
           and  does  make  allowances  for sections in overlays.
           The default behaviour can be  restored  by  using  the
           command line switch ----cchheecckk--sseeccttiioonnss.

       ----ccrreeff
           Output  a cross reference table.  If a linker map file
           is being  generated,  the  cross  reference  table  is
           printed  to the map file.  Otherwise, it is printed on
           the standard output.

           The format of the table is  intentionally  simple,  so
           that  it  may  be  easily  processed  by  a  script if
           necessary.  The symbols are  printed  out,  sorted  by
           name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.
           If the symbol is defined, the first file listed is the

           location  of  the  definition.   The  remaining  files
           contain references to the symbol.

       ----nnoo--ddeeffiinnee--ccoommmmoonn
           This option inhibits the assignment  of  addresses  to
           common      symbols.       The      script     command
           "INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

           The ----nnoo--ddeeffiinnee--ccoommmmoonn option  allows  decoupling  the
           decision  to  assign  addresses to Common symbols from
           the choice of the output file type; otherwise  a  non-
           Relocatable  output type forces assigning addresses to
           Common  symbols.   Using   ----nnoo--ddeeffiinnee--ccoommmmoonn   allows
           Common  symbols  that  are  referenced  from  a shared
           library to be assigned  addresses  only  in  the  main
           program.   This  eliminates the unused duplicate space
           in the shared library, and also prevents any  possible
           confusion  over  resolving to the wrong duplicate when
           there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
           paths for runtime symbol resolution.

           Create  a global symbol in the output file, containing
           the absolute address given by _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  You may use
           this  option  as  many  times  as  necessary to define
           multiple symbols in the command line.  A limited  form
           of  arithmetic is supported for the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n in this
           context: you may give a hexadecimal  constant  or  the
           name  of an existing symbol, or use "+" and "-" to add
           or subtract hexadecimal constants or symbols.  If  you
           need  more  elaborate  expressions, consider using the
           linker command language from a  script.   _N_o_t_e_:  there
           should  be  no  white space between _s_y_m_b_o_l, the equals
           sign ("=="), and _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.

           These options control whether to demangle symbol names
           in  error  messages and other output.  When the linker
           is told to demangle, it tries to present symbol  names
           in  a  readable fashion: it strips leading underscores
           if they are  used  by  the  object  file  format,  and
           converts  C++  mangled symbol names into user readable
           names.  Different compilers  have  different  mangling
           styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be
           used to choose an  appropriate  demangling  style  for
           your  compiler.   The  linker will demangle by default
           unless the environment variable CCOOLLLLEECCTT__NNOO__DDEEMMAANNGGLLEE is
           set.   These  options  may  be  used  to  override the
           default.

       ----nnoo--ffaattaall--wwaarrnniinnggss
           Treat all warnings as errors.  The  default  behaviour

           Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix.

           If  a successfully built fully linked output file does
           not have a ".exe" or ".dll" suffix, this option forces
           the  linker to copy the output file to one of the same
           name with a ".exe" suffix. This option is useful  when
           using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft Windows
           host, since some versions  of  Windows  won't  run  an
           image unless it ends in a ".exe" suffix.

           Enable  garbage  collection  of unused input sections.
           It is ignored on targets  that  do  not  support  this
           option.  The default behaviour (of not performing this
           garbage collection)  can  be  restored  by  specifying
           ----nnoo--ggcc--sseeccttiioonnss on the command line.

           ----ggcc--sseeccttiioonnss decides which input sections are used by
           examining  symbols  and  relocations.    The   section
           containing   the   entry   symbol   and  all  sections
           containing symbols undefined on the command-line  will
           be   kept,   as   will   sections  containing  symbols
           referenced  by  dynamic  objects.   Note   that   when
           building shared libraries, the linker must assume that
           any visible symbol is referenced.  Once  this  initial
           set  of  sections  has  been  determined,  the  linker
           recursively marks as used any  section  referenced  by
           their relocations.  See ----eennttrryy and ----uunnddeeffiinneedd.

           This  option  can  be  set  when  doing a partial link
           (enabled with option --rr).  In this case  the  root  of
           symbols  kept  must be explicitely specified either by
           an ----eennttrryy or  ----uunnddeeffiinneedd  option  or  by  a  "ENTRY"

           List  all sections removed by garbage collection.  The
           listing is printed on stderr.   This  option  is  only
           effective  if  garbage collection has been enabled via
           the ----ggcc--sseeccttiioonnss) option.  The default behaviour  (of

           lldd normally optimizes for speed over memory  usage  by
           caching  the  symbol  tables of input files in memory.
           This option tells lldd to instead  optimize  for  memory
           usage,  by  rereading  the symbol tables as necessary.
           This may be required if lldd runs out  of  memory  space
           while linking a large executable.

       --zz mmuullddeeffss
           Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times,  the
           linker  will report a fatal error. These options allow
           multiple definitions and the first definition will  be
           used.

           Allows (the default) or disallows undefined symbols in
           shared  libraries.   This   switch   is   similar   to
           ----nnoo--uunnddeeffiinneedd except that it determines the behaviour
           when the undefined symbols are  in  a  shared  library
           rather than a regular object file.  It does not affect
           how undefined symbols  in  regular  object  files  are
           handled.

           The reason that ----aallllooww--sshhlliibb--uunnddeeffiinneedd is the default
           is that the shared library  being  specified  at  link
           time  may not be the same as the one that is available
           at  load  time,  so  the  symbols  might  actually  be
           resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems,
           (eg BeOS) where undefined symbols in shared  libraries

           Apparently it is also normal for HPPA shared libraries
           to have undefined symbols.

           Normally when a symbol has an undefined  version,  the
           linker  will  ignore it. This option disallows symbols
           with undefined version  and  a  fatal  error  will  be

           together input files  that  are  mismatched  for  some
           reason,  perhaps  because  they have been compiled for
           different processors or  for  different  endiannesses.
           This  option  tells  lldd that it should silently permit
           such possible errors.  This option should only be used
           with  care,  in cases when you have taken some special
           action  that  ensures  that  the  linker  errors   are
           inappropriate.

           Normally  lldd  will  give  a  warning  if  it  finds an

           Retain the executable output file whenever it is still

           output file if it encounters errors  during  the  link
           process;  it exits without writing an output file when
           it issues any error whatsoever.

           object file.  If your lldd is configured this  way,  you
           can  use  the  ----ooffoorrmmaatt  option to specify the binary
           format for the output object file.  Even  when  lldd  is
           configured  to support alternative object formats, you
           don't usually need to specify this, as  lldd  should  be
           configured  to  produce as a default output format the
           most usual format on each machine.  _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t is a
           text string, the name of a particular format supported
           by the BFD libraries.  (You  can  list  the  available
           binary  formats  with oobbjjdduummpp --ii.)  The script command
           "OUTPUT_FORMAT" can also specify  the  output  format,
           but this option overrides it.

       --ppiiee
       ----ppiicc--eexxeeccuuttaabbllee
           Create  a  position  independent  executable.  This is
           currently only supported on ELF  platforms.   Position
           independent   executables   are   similar   to  shared
           libraries in that they are relocated  by  the  dynamic
           linker  to the virtual address the OS chooses for them
           (which can vary  between  invocations).   Like  normal
           dynamically  linked  executables  they can be executed
           and  symbols  defined  in  the  executable  cannot  be
           overridden by shared libraries.

       --qqmmaaggiicc
           This option is ignored for Linux compatibility.

       --QQyy This option is ignored for SVR4 compatibility.

       ----rreellaaxx
           An option with machine dependent effects.  This option
           is only supported on a few targets.

           On some platforms, the ----rreellaaxx option performs  global
           optimizations  that  become  possible  when the linker
           resolves addressing in the program, such  as  relaxing
           address modes and synthesizing new instructions in the
           output object file.

           On some platforms these link time global optimizations
           may   make   symbolic   debugging   of  the  resulting
           executable impossible.  This is known to be  the  case
           for  the  Matsushita  MN10200  and  MN10300  family of
           processors.

           On platforms where this is not supported,  ----rreellaaxx  is
           accepted, but ignored.

           Retain  _o_n_l_y  the symbols listed in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
           discarding all others.   _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is  simply  a  flat

           file,  with  one symbol name per line.  This option is
           especially useful in environments  (such  as  VxWorks)
           where  a  large  global  symbol  table  is accumulated
           gradually, to conserve run-time memory.

           ----rreettaaiinn--ssyymmbboollss--ffiillee  does  _n_o_t   discard   undefined
           symbols, or symbols needed for relocations.

           You may only specify ----rreettaaiinn--ssyymmbboollss--ffiillee once in the
           command line.  It overrides --ss and --SS.

       --rrppaatthh _d_i_r
           Add a directory to the runtime  library  search  path.
           This  is  used  when  linking  an  ELF executable with
           shared objects.  All --rrppaatthh arguments are concatenated
           and  passed  to the runtime linker, which uses them to
           locate shared objects at runtime.  The  --rrppaatthh  option
           is  also  used  when locating shared objects which are
           needed by shared objects explicitly  included  in  the
           link;  see  the description of the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option.
           If --rrppaatthh is not used when linking an ELF  executable,
           the contents of the environment variable "LD_RUN_PATH"
           will be used if it is defined.

           The --rrppaatthh option may  also  be  used  on  SunOS.   By
           default,  on  SunOS,  the  linker  will form a runtime
           search patch out of all the --LL options  it  is  given.
           If  a  --rrppaatthh  option is used, the runtime search path
           will be formed exclusively using the  --rrppaatthh  options,
           ignoring  the  --LL  options.   This  can be useful when
           using gcc, which adds many --LL options which may be  on
           NFS mounted file systems.

           For  compatibility  with  other ELF linkers, if the --RR
           option is followed by a directory name, rather than  a
           file name, it is treated as the --rrppaatthh option.

       --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk _D_I_R
           When  using  ELF  or  SunOS,  one  shared  library may
           require another.  This happens when  an  "ld  -shared"
           link  includes  a  shared  library as one of the input
           files.

           When the linker  encounters  such  a  dependency  when
           doing  a  non-shared,  non-relocatable  link,  it will
           automatically  try  to  locate  the  required   shared
           library  and  include  it  in  the  link, if it is not
           included explicitly.  In such a case, the  --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk
           option  specifies  the  first  set  of  directories to
           search.  The --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option may specify a sequence
           of  directory  names  either  by  specifying a list of
           names separated by colons, or  by  appearing  multiple
           times.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           This   option  should  be  used  with  caution  as  it
           overrides the search path  that  may  have  been  hard
           compiled  into  a shared library. In such a case it is
           possible to use  unintentionally  a  different  search
           path than the runtime linker would do.

           The  linker  uses the following search paths to locate
           required shared libraries:

           1.  Any directories specified by --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk  options.

           2.  Any  directories specified by --rrppaatthh options.  The
               difference between --rrppaatthh and --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk is  that
               directories   specified   by  --rrppaatthh  options  are
               included in the executable and  used  at  runtime,
               whereas  the  --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option is only effective
               at link time. Searching --rrppaatthh in this way is only
               supported  by  native  linkers  and  cross linkers
               which have been configured with the ----wwiitthh--ssyyssrroooott
               option.

           3.  On  an  ELF  system,  for  native  linkers, if the
               --rrppaatthh and  --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk  options  were  not  used,
               search  the  contents  of the environment variable
               "LD_RUN_PATH".

           4.  On SunOS, if  the  --rrppaatthh  option  was  not  used,
               search any directories specified using --LL options.

           5.  For a native linker, the search  the  contents  of
               the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".

           6.  For  a  native  ELF  linker,  the  directories  in
               "DT_RUNPATH" or "DT_RPATH" of a shared library are
               searched  for  shared  libraries needed by it. The
               "DT_RPATH" entries  are  ignored  if  "DT_RUNPATH"
               entries exist.

           7.  The   default   directories,   normally  _/_l_i_b  and
               _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b.

           8.  For a native linker on an ELF system, if the  file
               _/_e_t_c_/_l_d_._s_o_._c_o_n_f  exists,  the  list of directories
               found in that file.

           If the required  shared  library  is  not  found,  the
           linker  will  issue  a  warning  and continue with the
           link.

           This option tells lldd to sort  the  common  symbols  by
           alignment  in  ascending  or  descending order when it
           places them in the appropriate output  sections.   The
           symbol   alignments  considered  are  sixteen-byte  or
           larger, eight-byte, four-byte, two-byte, and one-byte.
           This  is  to  prevent  gaps  between  symbols  due  to
           alignment  constraints.   If  no  sorting   order   is
           specified, then descending order is assumed.

       ----ssoorrtt--sseeccttiioonn nnaammee
           This  option will apply "SORT_BY_NAME" to all wildcard
           section patterns in the linker script.

       ----ssoorrtt--sseeccttiioonn aalliiggnnmmeenntt

           Similar  to  ----sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc but creates a new output
           section for each input  file  when  _s_i_z_e  is  reached.
           _s_i_z_e defaults to a size of 1 if not given.

       ----sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc [[_c_o_u_n_t]]
           Tries  to creates extra sections in the output file so
           that no single output section  in  the  file  contains
           more  than  _c_o_u_n_t  relocations.   This  is useful when
           generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
           certain  real  time  kernels with the COFF object file
           format; since COFF cannot represent  more  than  65535
           relocations  in a single section.  Note that this will
           fail to work with object file  formats  which  do  not
           support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split
           up individual input sections for redistribution, so if
           a  single  input  section  contains  more  than  _c_o_u_n_t
           relocations one output section will contain that  many
           relocations.  _c_o_u_n_t defaults to a value of 32768.

       ----ssttaattss
           Compute  and display statistics about the operation of

       ----ssyyssrroooott==_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           Use  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  as  the  location  of   the   sysroot,
           overriding the configure-time default.  This option is
           only supported by linkers that were  configured  using
           ----wwiitthh--ssyyssrroooott.

       ----ttrraaddiittiioonnaall--ffoorrmmaatt
           For  some  targets,  the  output of lldd is different in
           some ways from the output  of  some  existing  linker.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           This  switch requests lldd to use the traditional format
           instead.

           For example, on SunOS, lldd combines  duplicate  entries
           in  the symbol string table.  This can reduce the size
           of an output file with full debugging  information  by
           over  30  percent.   Unfortunately,  the  SunOS  "dbx"
           program can not read the resulting program ("gdb"  has
           no trouble).  The ----ttrraaddiittiioonnaall--ffoorrmmaatt switch tells lldd
           to not combine duplicate entries.

           Locate a section in the output file  at  the  absolute
           address given by _o_r_g.  You may use this option as many
           times as necessary to locate multiple sections in  the
           command  line.   _o_r_g  must  be  a  single  hexadecimal
           integer; for compatibility with other linkers, you may

               Report  all  unresolved  symbols.   This  is   the
               default.

           iiggnnoorree--iinn--oobbjjeecctt--ffiilleess
               Report  unresolved  symbols  that are contained in
               shared libraries, but ignore  them  if  they  come
               from regular object files.

               Report  unresolved  symbols that come from regular
               object files, but ignore them if  they  come  from
               shared   libraries.    This  can  be  useful  when
               creating a dynamic binary and it is known that all
               the shared libraries that it should be referencing
               are included on the linker's command line.

           The behaviour for shared libraries on  their  own  can

           Normally the linker will generate an error message for
           each   reported   unresolved  symbol  but  the  option

           Specify the name of a version script  to  the  linker.
           This  is typically used when creating shared libraries
           to specify additional information  about  the  version
           hierarchy  for the library being created.  This option
           is only meaningful  on  ELF  platforms  which  support
           shared libraries.

       ----wwaarrnn--ccoommmmoonn
           Warn  when  a  common  symbol is combined with another
           common symbol  or  with  a  symbol  definition.   Unix
           linkers  allow  this  somewhat  sloppy  practise,  but
           linkers on some other operating systems do not.   This
           option  allows  you  to  find  potential problems from
           combining  global  symbols.   Unfortunately,  some   C
           libraries  use  this  practise,  so  you  may get some
           warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as  in
           your programs.

           There  are  three kinds of global symbols, illustrated
           here by C examples:

           iinntt ii == 11;;
               A definition, which goes in the  initialized  data
               section of the output file.

           eexxtteerrnn iinntt ii;;
               An  undefined  reference,  which does not allocate
               space.  There must be either  a  definition  or  a
               common symbol for the variable somewhere.

           iinntt ii;;
               A  common symbol.  If there are only (one or more)
               common symbols for a  variable,  it  goes  in  the
               uninitialized  data  area of the output file.  The
               linker merges multiple common symbols for the same
               variable  into  a  single  symbol.  If they are of
               different sizes, it picks the largest  size.   The
               linker  turns  a common symbol into a declaration,
               if there is a definition of the same variable.

           The ----wwaarrnn--ccoommmmoonn option can  produce  five  kinds  of
           warnings.   Each  warning consists of a pair of lines:
           the first describes the symbol just  encountered,  and
           the  second  describes the previous symbol encountered
           with the same name.  One or both of  the  two  symbols
           will be a common symbol.

           1.  Turning  a common symbol into a reference, because
               there is already a definition for the symbol.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overridden by definition
                       <file>(<section>): warning: defined here

           2.  Turning a common symbol into a reference,  because
               a  later definition for the symbol is encountered.
               This is the same as the previous case, except that
               the  symbols are encountered in a different order.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: definition of `<symbol>'
                          overriding common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: common is here

           3.  Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized
               common symbol.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: multiple common
                          of `<symbol>'
                       <file>(<section>): warning: previous common is here

           4.  Merging  a  common  symbol  with a previous larger
               common symbol.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overridden by larger common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: larger common is here

           5.  Merging a common symbol with  a  previous  smaller
               common  symbol.   This is the same as the previous
               case, except that the symbols are encountered in a
               different order.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overriding smaller common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: smaller common is here

       ----wwaarrnn--ccoonnssttrruuccttoorrss
           Warn  if  any  global  constructors are used.  This is
           only useful  for  a  few  object  file  formats.   For
           formats  like  COFF  or ELF, the linker can not detect
           the use of global constructors.

       ----wwaarrnn--mmuullttiippllee--ggpp

           the  output file.  This is only meaningful for certain
           processors, such as  the  Alpha.   Specifically,  some
           processors  put  large-valued  constants  in a special
           section.  A  special  register  (the  global  pointer)
           points  into  the  middle  of  this  section,  so that
           constants  can  be  loaded  efficiently  via  a  base-
           register  relative  addressing mode.  Since the offset
           in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively
           small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of
           the constant pool.  Thus, in  large  programs,  it  is
           often  necessary to use multiple global pointer values
           in order to be able to address all possible constants.
           This  option  causes  a  warning to be issued whenever
           this case occurs.

       ----wwaarrnn--oonnccee
           Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather  than
           once per module which refers to it.

       ----wwaarrnn--sseeccttiioonn--aalliiggnn
           Warn  if  the  address of an output section is changed
           because of alignment.  Typically, the  alignment  will
           be  set by an input section.  The address will only be
           changed if it not explicitly specified;  that  is,  if
           the  "SECTIONS"  command  does  not  specify  a  start
           address for the section.

       ----wwaarrnn--sshhaarreedd--tteexxttrreell
           Warn if the linker  adds  a  DT_TEXTREL  to  a  shared
           object.

       ----wwaarrnn--uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss
           If  the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol
           (see the option ----uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss) it will normally
           generate  an  error.   This option makes it generate a
           warning instead.

       ----eerrrroorr--uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss
           This  restores  the  linker's  default  behaviour   of
           generating  errors  when  it  is  reporting unresolved
           symbols.

       ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee
           For each archive mentioned on the command  line  after
           the  ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee option, include every object file
           in the archive in the link, rather than searching  the
           archive  for  the  required  object  files.   This  is
           normally used to turn an archive file  into  a  shared
           library,  forcing  every  object to be included in the
           resulting shared library.  This  option  may  be  used
           more than once.

           Two  notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc
           doesn't know about this option, so  you  have  to  use

           --WWll,,--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee.    Second,  don't  forget  to  use
           --WWll,,--nnoo--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee after  your  list  of  archives,
           because  gcc will add its own list of archives to your
           link and you may not want this flag to affect those as
           well.

       ----wwrraapp _s_y_m_b_o_l
           Use  a  wrapper  function  for  _s_y_m_b_o_l.  Any undefined
           reference   to   _s_y_m_b_o_l   will    be    resolved    to
           "__wrap_symbol".     Any    undefined   reference   to
           "__real_symbol" will be resolved to _s_y_m_b_o_l.

           This can be used to provide a  wrapper  for  a  system
           function.   The  wrapper  function  should  be  called
           "__wrap_symbol".  If it  wishes  to  call  the  system
           function, it should call "__real_symbol".

           Here is a trivial example:

                   void *
                   __wrap_malloc (size_t c)
                   {
                     printf ("malloc called with %zu\n", c);
                     return __real_malloc (c);
                   }

           If  you  link  other  code with this file using ----wwrraapp
           mmaalllloocc, then all  calls  to  "malloc"  will  call  the
           function   "__wrap_malloc"   instead.    The  call  to
           "__real_malloc" in "__wrap_malloc" will call the  real
           "malloc" function.

           You  may wish to provide a "__real_malloc" function as
           well, so that links without  the  ----wwrraapp  option  will
           succeed.   If  you  do  this,  you  should not put the
           definition of "__real_malloc"  in  the  same  file  as
           "__wrap_malloc";  if you do, the assembler may resolve
           the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it  to
           "malloc".

       ----eehh--ffrraammee--hhddrr
           Request  creation  of  ".eh_frame_hdr" section and ELF
           "PT_GNU_EH_FRAME" segment header.

       ----ddiissaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss
           This linker can create the new dynamic  tags  in  ELF.
           But  the older ELF systems may not understand them. If
           you specify ----eennaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss, the dynamic tags  will
           be    created    as    needed.     If    you   specify
           ----ddiissaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss,  no  new  dynamic  tags  will  be
           created.  By  default,  the  new  dynamic tags are not
           created. Note that those options  are  only  available
           for ELF systems.

       ----hhaasshh--ssiizzee==_n_u_m_b_e_r
           Set  the default size of the linker's hash tables to a
           prime number close to _n_u_m_b_e_r.  Increasing  this  value
           can  reduce  the length of time it takes the linker to
           perform its tasks, at the expense  of  increasing  the
           linker's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this
           value  can  reduce  the  memory  requirements  at  the
           expense of speed.

       ----hhaasshh--ssttyyllee==_s_t_y_l_e
           Set  the type of linker's hash table(s).  _s_t_y_l_e can be
           either "sysv" for classic ELF ".hash"  section,  "gnu"
           for  new  style  GNU ".gnu.hash" section or "both" for
           both  the  classic  ELF  ".hash"  and  new  style  GNU
           ".gnu.hash" hash tables.  The default is "sysv".

       ----rreedduuccee--mmeemmoorryy--oovveerrhheeaaddss
           This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime,
           at the expense of linking speed.  This was  introduced
           to  select  the old O(n^2) algorithm for link map file
           generation, rather than the new O(n)  algorithm  which
           uses about 40% more memory for symbol storage.

           Another  effect  of  the  switch is to set the default
           hash table size to 1021, which again saves  memory  at
           the  cost  of lengthening the linker's run time.  This
           is not done however if the ----hhaasshh--ssiizzee switch has been
           used.

           used to enable other tradeoffs in future  versions  of
           the linker.

       ----bbuuiilldd--iidd==_s_t_y_l_e
           Request  creation  of  ".note.gnu.build-id"  ELF  note
           section.  The contents of the  note  are  unique  bits
           identifying  this linked file.  _s_t_y_l_e can be "uuid" to
           use 128 random bits, "sha1" to use a 160-bit SHA1 hash
           on  the  normative parts of the output contents, "md5"
           to use a 128-bit MD5 hash on the  normative  parts  of
           the  output contents, or "0xhexstring" to use a chosen
           bit string specified as an even number of  hexadecimal
           digits ("-" and ":" characters between digit pairs are
           ignored).  If _s_t_y_l_e is omitted, "sha1" is used.

           The "md5" and "sha1"  styles  produces  an  identifier
           that  is  always the same in an identical output file,
           but will  be  unique  among  all  nonidentical  output
           files.   It  is  not  intended  to  be  compared  as a
           checksum for the file's contents.  A linked  file  may
           be  changed later by other tools, but the build ID bit
           string identifying the original linked file  does  not
           change.

       output "*.dll" when you use this option.  In addition, the
       linker fully supports the standard  "*.def"  files,  which
       may be specified on the linker command line like an object
       file (in fact,  it  should  precede  archives  it  exports
       symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like
       a normal object file).

       In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386
       PE linker support additional command line options that are
       specific to the i386 PE target.  Options that take  values
       may be separated from their values by either a space or an
       equals sign.

           If given, symbols with a stdcall suffix (@_n_n) will  be
           exported  as-is  and  also  with  the suffix stripped.

           base addresses  of  all  the  relocations  needed  for

           Create a DLL instead of a regular executable.  You may
           also  use  --sshhaarreedd  or  specify a "LIBRARY" in a given

           If  the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it
           will attempt to do  "fuzzy  linking"  by  looking  for
           another defined symbol that differs only in the format
           of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will resolve
           that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
           undefined  symbol  "_foo"  might  be  linked  to   the
           function  "_foo@12", or the undefined symbol "_bar@16"
           might be linked to  the  function  "_bar".   When  the
           linker  does  this,  it  prints  a  warning,  since it
           normally should have failed  to  link,  but  sometimes
           import  libraries  generated from third-party dlls may
           need this  feature  to  be  usable.   If  you  specify

           If given, all global symbols in the  objects  used  to
           build  a  DLL  will be exported by the DLL.  Note that
           this is the default if there otherwise wouldn't be any
           exported   symbols.    When   symbols  are  explicitly
           exported via DEF  files  or  implicitly  exported  via
           function  attributes,  the  default  is  to not export
           anything else unless this option is given.  Note  that
           the     symbols    "DllMain@12",    "DllEntryPoint@0",
           "DllMainCRTStartup@12", and "impure_ptr" will  not  be
           automatically  exported.   Also, symbols imported from
           other DLLs will not be re-exported, nor  will  symbols
           specifying  the  DLL's  internal  layout such as those
           beginning with "_head_" or ending with  "_iname".   In
           addition,   no   symbols  from  "libgcc",  "libstd++",
           "libmingw32", or "crtX.o" will be  exported.   Symbols
           whose  names begin with "__rtti_" or "__builtin_" will
           not be exported, to  help  with  C++  DLLs.   Finally,
           there  is  an extensive list of cygwin-private symbols
           that are not exported (obviously, this applies on when

           does  not  conform to the PE-COFF format specification
           published by Microsoft.

           Note - use of the 'auto-import'  extension  will  also
           cause  read  only  data which would normally be placed
           into the .rdata section to be placed  into  the  .data
           section  instead.   This  is in order to work around a
           problem  with   consts   that   is   described   here:
           http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html

           Using  'auto-import' generally will 'just work' -- but
           sometimes you may see this message:

           "variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please  read
           the  documentation for ld's "--enable-auto-import" for
           details."

           This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses
           an   address  ultimately  given  by  the  sum  of  two
           constants  (Win32  import  tables  only  allow   one).
           Instances  where  this  may  occur include accesses to
           member fields of struct variables imported from a DLL,
           as  well  as  using  a  constant  index  into an array
           variable imported from a DLL.  Any multiword  variable
           (arrays,  structs,  long  long,  etc) may trigger this
           error condition.  However,  regardless  of  the  exact
           data  type of the offending exported variable, ld will
           always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.

           There are several ways  to  address  this  difficulty,
           regardless of the data type of the exported variable:

           One   way   is  to  use  --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc
           switch. This leaves the task of  adjusting  references
           in  your  client code for runtime environment, so this
           method works only when  runtime  environment  supports
           this feature.

           A  second  solution is to force one of the 'constants'
           to  be  a  variable  --  that  is,  unknown  and   un-
           optimizable  at  compile  time.  For arrays, there are
           two possibilities: a) make the  indexee  (the  array's
           address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a
           variable.  Thus:

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] -->
                      { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }

           or

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] -->
                      { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           For structs (and most other multiword data types)  the
           only  option is to make the struct itself (or the long
           long, or the ...) variable:

                   extern struct s extern_struct;
                   extern_struct.field -->
                      { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field }

           or

                   extern long long extern_ll;

                     { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }

           A third method of dealing with this difficulty  is  to
           abandon  'auto-import'  for  the  offending symbol and
           mark it  with  "__declspec(dllimport)".   However,  in
           practise  that requires using compile-time #defines to
           indicate whether you  are  building  a  DLL,  building
           client  code  that  will  link  to  the DLL, or merely
           building/linking to a static library.   In making  the
           choice  between  the  various methods of resolving the
           'direct address with  constant  offset'  problem,  you
           should consider typical real-world usage:

           Original:

                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 1:

                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
                     volatile int *parr = arr;
                     printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 2:

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


                   --foo.h
                   /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
                   #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \
                     !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
                   #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
                   #else
                   #define FOO_IMPORT
                   #endif
                   extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           A  fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
           library to use a functional interface  rather  than  a
           data  interface  for  the  offending  variables  (e.g.
           _s_e_t___f_o_o_(_) and _g_e_t___f_o_o_(_)  accessor  functions).   [This
           option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
           linker]

       ----ddiissaabbllee--aauuttoo--iimmppoorrtt
           Do  not  attempt  to  do  sophisticated   linking   of
           "_symbol"  to  "__imp__symbol"  for  DATA imports from
           DLLs.   [This  option  is  specific  to  the  i386  PE
           targeted port of the linker]

           If   your   code  contains  expressions  described  in
           --enable-auto-import section, that  is,  DATA  imports
           from DLL with non-zero offset, this switch will create
           a vector of 'runtime pseudo relocations' which can  be
           used  by  runtime  environment to adjust references to
           such data  in  your  client  code.   [This  option  is
           specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

           Do  not  create pseudo relocations for non-zero offset
           DATA imports from DLLs.  This is the  default.   [This
           option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
           linker]

       ----eennaabbllee--eexxttrraa--ppee--ddeebbuugg
           Show additional  debug  info  related  to  auto-import
           symbol thunking.  [This option is specific to the i386
           PE targeted port of the linker]

       ----sseeccttiioonn--aalliiggnnmmeenntt
           Sets the section alignment.  Sections in  memory  will
           always begin at addresses which are a multiple of this
           number.  Defaults to 0x1000.  [This option is specific
           to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

           Specifies  the subsystem under which your program will
           execute.  The legal values  for  _w_h_i_c_h  are  "native",
           "windows",  "console",  "posix",  and "xbox".  You may
           optionally set the subsystem  version  also.   Numeric
           values  are  also accepted for _w_h_i_c_h.  [This option is

       The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options  to
       control  the  memory bank switching mapping and trampoline
       code generation.

       ----nnoo--ttrraammppoolliinnee
           This option disables the generation of trampoline.  By
           default   a  trampoline  is  generated  for  each  far
           function which is called  using  a  "jsr"  instruction
           (this  happens  when  a  pointer  to a far function is
           taken).

       ----bbaannkk--wwiinnddooww _n_a_m_e
           This option indicates to the linker the  name  of  the
           memory   region   in  the  MMEEMMOORRYY  specification  that
           describes the memory bank window.  The  definition  of
           such  region  is  then  used  by the linker to compute
           paging and addresses within the memory window.

       The following options are supported to control handling of
       GOT generation when linking for 68K targets.

       ----ggoott==_t_y_p_e
           This  option  tells  the  linker  which GOT generation
           scheme  to  use.   _t_y_p_e  should  be  one  of   ssiinnggllee,
           nneeggaattiivvee,  mmuullttiiggoott  or  ttaarrggeett.  For more information
           refer to the Info entry for _l_d.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       You can change the behaviour of lldd  with  the  environment
       variables       "GNUTARGET",       "LDEMULATION"       and
       "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE".

       "GNUTARGET" determines the input-file object format if you
       don't  use --bb (or its synonym ----ffoorrmmaatt).  Its value should
       be one of the BFD names for an input format.  If there  is
       no  "GNUTARGET"  in  the  environment, lldd uses the natural

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       format of the target. If "GNUTARGET" is set  to  "default"
       then   BFD  attempts  to  discover  the  input  format  by
       examining binary input files; this method often  succeeds,
       but  there  are  potential  ambiguities, since there is no
       method of ensuring that the magic number used  to  specify
       object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration
       procedure for BFD on each system places  the  conventional
       format  for  that  system  first  in  the  search-list, so
       ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.

       "LDEMULATION" determines  the  default  emulation  if  you
       don't use the --mm option.  The emulation can affect various
       aspects of  linker  behaviour,  particularly  the  default
       linker script.  You can list the available emulations with
       the ----vveerrbboossee or --VV options.  If  the  --mm  option  is  not
       used,  and  the  "LDEMULATION" environment variable is not
       defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker
       was configured.

       Normally,  the  linker will default to demangling symbols.
       However,  if   "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE"   is   set   in   the
       environment,  then  it  will  default  to  not  demangling
       symbols.  This environment variable is used in  a  similar
       fashion  by the "gcc" linker wrapper program.  The default
       may be overridden  by  the  ----ddeemmaannggllee  and  ----nnoo--ddeemmaannggllee
       options.
