       ggccoovv is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with
       GCC to analyze your programs to help create more
       efficient, faster running code and to discover untested
       parts of your program.  You can use ggccoovv as a profiling
       tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will
       best affect your code.  You can also use ggccoovv along with
       the other profiling tool, ggpprrooff, to assess which parts of
       your code use the greatest amount of computing time.

       Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.
       Using a profiler such as ggccoovv or ggpprrooff, you can find out
       some basic performance statistics, such as:

       +o   how often each line of code executes

       +o   what lines of code are actually executed

       +o   how much computing time each section of code uses

       Once you know these things about how your code works when
       compiled, you can look at each module to see which modules
       should be optimized.  ggccoovv helps you determine where to
       work on optimization.

       Software developers also use coverage testing in concert
       with testsuites, to make sure software is actually good
       enough for a release.  Testsuites can verify that a
       program works as expected; a coverage program tests to see
       how much of the program is exercised by the testsuite.
       Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases
       need to be added to the testsuites to create both better
       testing and a better final product.

       You should compile your code without optimization if you
       plan to use ggccoovv because the optimization, by combining
       some lines of code into one function, may not give you as
       much information as you need to look for `hot spots' where
       the code is using a great deal of computer time.

       Likewise, because ggccoovv accumulates statistics by line (at
       the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming
       style that places only one statement on each line.  If you
       use complicated macros that expand to loops or to other
       control structures, the statistics are less helpful---they
       only report on the line where the macro call appears.  If
       your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace
       them with inline functions to solve this problem.

       ggccoovv creates a logfile called _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e_._g_c_o_v which
       indicates how many times each line of a source file
       _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e_._c has executed.  You can use these logfiles
       along with ggpprrooff to aid in fine-tuning the performance of
       your programs.  ggpprrooff gives timing information you can use
       along with the information you get from ggccoovv.

       ggccoovv works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not
       compatible with any other profiling or test coverage
       mechanism.

           option allows you to see how often each branch in your

           Create long file names for included source files.  For
           example, if the header file _x_._h contains code, and was
           included in the file _a_._c, then running ggccoovv on the
           file _a_._c will produce an output file called
           _a_._c_#_#_x_._h_._g_c_o_v instead of _x_._h_._g_c_o_v.  This can be useful
           if _x_._h is included in multiple source files.  If you
           use the --pp option, both the including and included
           file names will be complete path names.

           directories are used, with // characters translated to
           ## characters, _. directory components removed and _._.
           components renamed to ^^.  This is useful if
           sourcefiles are in several different directories.  It

           data files are searched for using this option.  If a
           directory is specified, the data files are in that
           directory and named after the source file name,
           without its extension.  If a file is specified here,
           the data files are named after that file, without its
           extension.  If this option is not supplied, it
           defaults to the current directory.

       ggccoovv should be run with the current directory the same as

       contain the coverage information of the source file they
       correspond to.  One _._g_c_o_v file is produced for each source
       file containing code, which was compiled to produce the
       data files.  The _m_a_n_g_l_e_d_n_a_m_e part of the output file name
       is usually simply the source file name, but can be
       something more complicated if the --ll or --pp options are
       given.  Refer to those options for details.

       The _._g_c_o_v files contain the :: separated fields along with
       program source code.  The format is

               <execution_count>:<line_number>:<source line text>

       Additional block information may succeed each line, when
       requested by command line option.  The _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n___c_o_u_n_t is
       -- for lines containing no code and ########## for lines which
       were never executed.  Some lines of information at the
       start have _l_i_n_e___n_u_m_b_e_r of zero.

       The preamble lines are of the form

               -:0:<tag>:<value>

       The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be
       augmented as ggccoovv development progresses --- do not rely
       on them remaining unchanged.  Use _t_a_g to locate a
       particular preamble line.

       The additional block information is of the form

               <tag> <information>

       The _i_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n is human readable, but designed to be
       simple enough for machine parsing too.

       When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed
       when the values are _e_x_a_c_t_l_y 0% and 100% respectively.
       Other values which would conventionally be rounded to 0%
       or 100% are instead printed as the nearest non-boundary
       value.

       When using ggccoovv, you must first compile your program with
       two special GCC options: --ffpprrooffiillee--aarrccss --fftteesstt--ccoovveerraaggee.
       This tells the compiler to generate additional information
       needed by gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and
       also includes additional code in the object files for
       generating the extra profiling information needed by gcov.
       These additional files are placed in the directory where
       the object file is located.

       Running the program will cause profile output to be
       generated.  For each source file compiled with
       --ffpprrooffiillee--aarrccss, an accompanying _._g_c_d_a file will be placed
       in the object file directory.

       Running ggccoovv with your program's source file names as
       arguments will now produce a listing of the code along
       with frequency of execution for each line.  For example,
       if your program is called _t_m_p_._c, this is what you see when
       you use the basic ggccoovv facility:

               $ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
               $ a.out
               $ gcov tmp.c
               90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
               Creating tmp.c.gcov.

       The file _t_m_p_._c_._g_c_o_v contains output from ggccoovv.  Here is a
       sample:

                       -:    0:Source:tmp.c
                       -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno

                       1:    4:{
                       1:    5:  int i, total;
                       -:    6:
                       1:    7:  total = 0;
                       -:    8:
                      11:    9:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                      10:   10:    total += i;
                       -:   11:
                       1:   12:  if (total != 45)
                   #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
                       -:   14:  else
                       1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");

                       -:   17:}

       When you use the --aa option, you will get individual block
       counts, and the output looks like this:

                       1:   15-block  0
                       1:   16:  return 0;
                       1:   16-block  0
                       -:   17:}

       In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line
       -- the last line of the block.  A multi-line block will
       only contribute to the execution count of that last line,
       and other lines will not be shown to contain code, unless
       previous blocks end on those lines.  The total execution
       count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show the
       execution counts for individual blocks that end on that
       line.  After each block, the branch and call counts of the
       block will be shown, if the --bb option is given.

       Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can
       be shown after a line with no individual blocks.  As you
       can see, line 13 contains a basic block that was not
       executed.

       When you use the --bb option, your output looks like this:

               $ gcov -b tmp.c
               90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c

               80.00% of 5 branches taken at least once in file tmp.c
               50.00% of 2 calls executed in file tmp.c
               Creating tmp.c.gcov.

       For each function, a line is printed showing how many
       times the function is called, how many times it returns
       and what percentage of the function's blocks were
       executed.

       For each basic block, a line is printed after the last
       line of the basic block describing the branch or call that
       ends the basic block.  There can be multiple branches and
       calls listed for a single source line if there are
       multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this
       case, the branches and calls are each given a number.
       There is no simple way to map these branches and calls
       back to source constructs.  In general, though, the lowest
       numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost
       construct on the source line.

       For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a
       percentage indicating the number of times the branch was
       taken divided by the number of times the branch was
       executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the message "never
       executed" is printed.

       For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a
       percentage indicating the number of times the call
       returned divided by the number of times the call was
       executed will be printed.  This will usually be 100%, but
       may be less for functions that call "exit" or "longjmp",
       and thus may not return every time they are called.

       The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example
       program were executed again without removing the _._g_c_d_a
       file, the count for the number of times each line in the
       source was executed would be added to the results of the
       previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in several
       ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data
       over a number of program runs as part of a test
       verification suite, or to provide more accurate long-term
       information over a large number of program runs.

       The data in the _._g_c_d_a files is saved immediately before
       the program exits.  For each source file compiled with
       --ffpprrooffiillee--aarrccss, the profiling code first attempts to read
       in an existing _._g_c_d_a file; if the file doesn't match the
       executable (differing number of basic block counts) it
       will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
       new execution counts and finally writes the data to the
       file.

       If you plan to use ggccoovv to help optimize your code, you
       must first compile your program with two special GCC
       options: --ffpprrooffiillee--aarrccss --fftteesstt--ccoovveerraaggee.  Aside from that,
       you can use any other GCC options; but if you want to
       prove that every single line in your program was executed,
       you should not compile with optimization at the same time.
       On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some simple
       code lines by combining them with other lines.  For
       example, code like this:

               if (a != b)
                 c = 1;
               else
                 c = 0;

       can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In
       this case, there is no way for ggccoovv to calculate separate
       execution counts for each line because there isn't
       separate code for each line.  Hence the ggccoovv output looks
       like this if you compiled the program with optimization:

                     100:   12:if (a != b)
                     100:   13:  c = 1;
                     100:   14:else
                     100:   15:  c = 0;




gcc-4.2.3                   2008-02-01                          8





GCOV(1)                        GNU                        GCOV(1)


       The output shows that this block of code, combined by
       optimization, executed 100 times.  In one sense this
       result is correct, because there was only one instruction
       representing all four of these lines.  However, the output
       does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
       many times the result was 1.

       Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts.
       Line counts are shown for the source code of the
       inlineable function, but what is shown depends on where
       the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined at all.

       If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an
       out of line copy of the function, in any object file that
       needs it.  If _f_i_l_e_A_._o and _f_i_l_e_B_._o both contain out of line
       bodies of a particular inlineable function, they will also
       both contain coverage counts for that function.  When
       _f_i_l_e_A_._o and _f_i_l_e_B_._o are linked together, the linker will,
       on many systems, select one of those out of line bodies
       for all calls to that function, and remove or ignore the
       other.  Unfortunately, it will not remove the coverage
       counters for the unused function body.  Hence when
       instrumented, all but one use of that function will show
       zero counts.

       If the function is inlined in several places, the block
       structure in each location might not be the same.  For
       instance, a condition might now be calculable at compile
       time in some instances.  Because the coverage of all the
       uses of the inline function will be shown for the same
       source lines, the line counts themselves might seem
       inconsistent.
