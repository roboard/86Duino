       "gprof" produces an execution profile  of  C,  Pascal,  or
       Fortran77  programs.   The  effect  of  called routines is
       incorporated in the profile of each caller.   The  profile
       data  is  taken from the call graph profile file (_g_m_o_n_._o_u_t
       default) which is created by programs  that  are  compiled
       with  the  --ppgg  option  of "cc", "pc", and "f77".  The --ppgg
       option also links in versions of the library routines that
       are  compiled  for  profiling.   "Gprof"  reads  the given
       object file (the default is "a.out") and  establishes  the
       relation  between  its  symbol  table  and  the call graph
       profile from _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t.  If more than one profile  file  is
       specified, the "gprof" output shows the sum of the profile
       information in the given profile files.

       "Gprof" calculates  the  amount  of  time  spent  in  each
       routine.  Next, these times are propagated along the edges
       of the call graph.  Cycles are discovered, and calls  into
       a cycle are made to share the time of the cycle.

       Several forms of output are available from the analysis.

       The _f_l_a_t _p_r_o_f_i_l_e shows how much time your program spent in
       each function,  and  how  many  times  that  function  was
       called.   If  you simply want to know which functions burn
       most of the cycles, it is stated concisely here.

       The _c_a_l_l _g_r_a_p_h shows, for each function,  which  functions
       called  it,  which other functions it called, and how many
       times.  There is also an estimate of  how  much  time  was
       spent  in  the  subroutines  of  each  function.  This can
       suggest places where you might try to  eliminate  function
       calls that use a lot of time.

       The  _a_n_n_o_t_a_t_e_d  _s_o_u_r_c_e  listing is a copy of the program's
       source code, labeled with the number of times each line of
       the program was executed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       These  options  specify  which  of  several output formats
       "gprof" should produce.

       Many of these options take an optional _s_y_m_s_p_e_c to  specify
       functions  to  be included or excluded.  These options can
       be specified multiple times, with different  symspecs,  to
       include or exclude sets of symbols.

       Specifying  any of these options overrides the default (--pp
       --qq), which prints a flat profile and call  graph  analysis
       for all functions.

       "-A[symspec]"
       "--annotated-source[=symspec]"
           The --AA option causes "gprof" to print annotated source
           code.  If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, print output only  for
           matching symbols.

       "-b"
       "--brief"
           If  the  --bb option is given, "gprof" doesn't print the
           verbose blurbs that try to explain the meaning of  all
           of  the  fields  in the tables.  This is useful if you
           intend to print out the output, or are tired of seeing
           the blurbs.

       "-C[symspec]"
       "--exec-counts[=symspec]"
           The  --CC  option  causes  "gprof"  to  print a tally of
           functions and the number of times each was called.  If
           _s_y_m_s_p_e_c  is  specified,  print tally only for matching
           symbols.

           If the profile data file  contains  basic-block  count
           records, specifying the --ll option, along with --CC, will
           cause basic-block execution counts to be  tallied  and
           displayed.

       "-i"
       "--file-info"
           The  --ii  option  causes  "gprof"  to  display  summary
           information about the profile data  file(s)  and  then
           exit.  The number of histogram, call graph, and basic-
           block count records is displayed.

       "-I dirs"
       "--directory-path=dirs"
           The --II option specifies a list of  search  directories
           in  which  to find source files.  Environment variable

           _G_P_R_O_F___P_A_T_H  can  also   be   used   to   convey   this
           information.  Used mostly for annotated source output.

       "-J[symspec]"
       "--no-annotated-source[=symspec]"
           The --JJ option causes "gprof" not  to  print  annotated
           source  code.  If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, "gprof" prints
           annotated source, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-L"
       "--print-path"
           Normally, source filenames are printed with  the  path
           component suppressed.  The --LL option causes "gprof" to
           print the full pathname of source filenames, which  is
           determined  from symbolic debugging information in the
           image file and is relative to the directory  in  which
           the compiler was invoked.

       "-p[symspec]"
       "--flat-profile[=symspec]"
           The  --pp option causes "gprof" to print a flat profile.
           If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, print flat profile  only  for
           matching symbols.

       "-P[symspec]"
       "--no-flat-profile[=symspec]"
           The  --PP  option  causes "gprof" to suppress printing a
           flat profile.  If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, "gprof" prints
           a flat profile, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-q[symspec]"
       "--graph[=symspec]"
           The  --qq  option causes "gprof" to print the call graph
           analysis.  If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, print  call  graph
           only for matching symbols and their children.

       "-Q[symspec]"
       "--no-graph[=symspec]"
           The  --QQ option causes "gprof" to suppress printing the
           call graph.  If _s_y_m_s_p_e_c is specified, "gprof" prints a
           call graph, but excludes matching symbols.

       "-t"
       "--table-length=num"
           The  --tt option causes the _n_u_m most active source lines
           in  each  source  file  to  be  listed   when   source
           annotation is enabled.  The default is 10.

       "-y"
       "--separate-files"
           This  option  affects  annotated  source  output only.
           Normally, "gprof" prints  annotated  source  files  to
           standard-output.    If   this   option  is  specified,
           annotated source for a  file  named  _p_a_t_h_/_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is

           generated in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_-_a_n_n.  If the underlying
           file system would truncate  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_-_a_n_n  so  that  it
           overwrites  the  original  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, "gprof" generates
           annotated source in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._a_n_n instead  (if
           the   original   file  name  has  an  extension,  that
           extension is _r_e_p_l_a_c_e_d with _._a_n_n).

       "-Z[symspec]"
       "--no-exec-counts[=symspec]"
           The --ZZ option causes "gprof" not to print a  tally  of
           functions and the number of times each was called.  If
           _s_y_m_s_p_e_c  is  specified,  print  tally,   but   exclude
           matching symbols.

       "-r"
       "--function-ordering"
           The ----ffuunnccttiioonn--oorrddeerriinngg option causes "gprof" to print
           a suggested function ordering for the program based on
           profiling  data.   This  option  suggests  an ordering
           which may improve paging, tlb and cache  behavior  for
           the   program   on  systems  which  support  arbitrary
           ordering of functions in an executable.

           The exact details of how to force the linker to  place
           functions  in  a  particular order is system dependent
           and out of the scope of this manual.

       "-R map_file"
       "--file-ordering map_file"
           The ----ffiillee--oorrddeerriinngg option causes "gprof" to  print  a
           suggested  .o link line ordering for the program based
           on profiling data.  This option suggests  an  ordering
           which  may  improve paging, tlb and cache behavior for
           the program on systems which do not support  arbitrary
           ordering of functions in an executable.

           Use of the --aa argument is highly recommended with this
           option.

           The _m_a_p___f_i_l_e argument is a pathname to  a  file  which
           provides  function  name to object file mappings.  The
           format of the file is similar to  the  output  of  the
           program "nm".

       "-T"
       "--traditional"
           The  --TT  option  causes "gprof" to print its output in
           "traditional" BSD style.

       "-w width"
       "--width=width"
           Sets width of output lines to _w_i_d_t_h.   Currently  only
           used when printing the function index at the bottom of
           the call graph.

       "-x"
       "--all-lines"
           This option affects annotated source output only.   By
           default,  only  the lines at the beginning of a basic-
           block are annotated.  If  this  option  is  specified,
           every  line in a basic-block is annotated by repeating
           the annotation for the first line.  This  behavior  is
           similar to "tcov"'s --aa.

       "--demangle[=style]"
       "--no-demangle"
           These  options control whether C++ symbol names should
           be demangled when printing output.  The default is  to
           demangle  symbols.   The "--no-demangle" option may be
           used to turn off demangling. Different compilers  have
           different  mangling  styles.   The optional demangling
           style argument can be used to  choose  an  appropriate
           demangling style for your compiler.

       "-a"
       "--no-static"
           The  --aa option causes "gprof" to suppress the printing
           of statically declared  (private)  functions.   (These
           are  functions  whose  names are not listed as global,
           and   which    are    not    visible    outside    the
           file/function/block  where  they  were defined.)  Time
           spent in these functions, calls  to/from  them,  etc.,
           will all be attributed to the function that was loaded
           directly before  it  in  the  executable  file.   This
           option  affects  both  the  flat  profile and the call
           graph.

       "-c"
       "--static-call-graph"
           The --cc option causes the call graph of the program  to
           be  augmented  by  a heuristic which examines the text
           space of the object file and identifies function calls

           in  the  binary machine code.  Since normal call graph
           records are only generated when functions are entered,
           this  option  identifies children that could have been
           called, but never were.  Calls to functions that  were
           not   compiled   with   profiling   enabled  are  also
           identified, but  only  if  symbol  table  entries  are
           present  for  them.  Calls to dynamic library routines
           are typically _n_o_t found by this  option.   Parents  or
           children  identified  via this heuristic are indicated
           in the call graph with call counts of 00.

       "-D"
       "--ignore-non-functions"
           The --DD option causes "gprof" to ignore  symbols  which
           are  not known to be functions.  This option will give
           more accurate profile data  on  systems  where  it  is
           supported (Solaris and HPUX for example).

       "-k from/to"
           The --kk option allows you to delete from the call graph
           any arcs from symbols matching symspec _f_r_o_m  to  those
           matching symspec _t_o.

       "-l"
       "--line"
           The  --ll  option  enables line-by-line profiling, which
           causes histogram hits  to  be  charged  to  individual
           source code lines, instead of functions.  This feature
           only works with programs compiled by older versions of
           the  "gcc"  compiler.   Newer  versions  of  "gcc" are
           designed to work with the "gcov" tool instead.

           If the program was compiled with basic-block  counting
           enabled, this option will also identify how many times
           each line of code was  executed.   While  line-by-line
           profiling can help isolate where in a large function a
           program is spending its time,  it  also  significantly
           increases  the  running time of "gprof", and magnifies
           statistical inaccuracies.

       "-m num"
       "--min-count=num"
           This  option  affects  execution  count  output  only.
           Symbols  that  are  executed  less  than _n_u_m times are
           suppressed.

       "-nsymspec"
       "--time=symspec"
           The --nn  option  causes  "gprof",  in  its  call  graph
           analysis, to only propagate times for symbols matching
           _s_y_m_s_p_e_c.

       "--no-time=symspec"
           The --nn  option  causes  "gprof",  in  its  call  graph
           analysis,  not to propagate times for symbols matching
           _s_y_m_s_p_e_c.

       "-z"
       "--display-unused-functions"
           If you give the --zz option, "gprof"  will  mention  all
           functions  in  the  flat profile, even those that were
           never called, and that had  no  time  spent  in  them.
           This  is  useful in conjunction with the --cc option for
           discovering which routines were never called.

       "-d[num]"
       "--debug[=num]"
           The --dd _n_u_m option specifies debugging options.  If _n_u_m
           is not specified, enable all debugging.

       "-h"
       "--help"
           The --hh option prints command line usage.

       "-Oname"
       "--file-format=name"
           Selects   the   format  of  the  profile  data  files.
           Recognized  formats  are  aauuttoo  (the  default),   bbssdd,
           44..44bbssdd, mmaaggiicc, and pprrooff (not yet supported).

       "-s"
       "--sum"
           The   --ss   option  causes  "gprof"  to  summarize  the
           information in the profile data files it read in,  and
           write  out  a profile data file called _g_m_o_n_._s_u_m, which
           contains all the information  from  the  profile  data
           files  that "gprof" read in.  The file _g_m_o_n_._s_u_m may be
           one of the specified input files; the effect  of  this
           is  to  merge  the  data in the other input files into
           _g_m_o_n_._s_u_m.

           Eventually you can run "gprof"  again  without  --ss  to
           analyze the cumulative data in the file _g_m_o_n_._s_u_m.

       "-v"
       "--version"
           The  --vv  flag  causes  "gprof"  to  print  the current
           version number, and then exit.

       "-e function_name"
           The  --ee  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n  option  tells  "gprof" to not print
           information about the function _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e (and  its
           children...)  in  the  call  graph.  The function will
           still be listed as a child of any functions that  call
           it,  but  its  index  number  will  be  shown  as [[nnoott
           pprriinntteedd]].  More than one --ee option may be given;  only
           one  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e  may  be  indicated  with  each  --ee
           option.

       "-E function_name"
           The "-E function" option works like the  "-e"  option,
           but  time spent in the function (and children who were
           not called from anywhere else), will not  be  used  to
           compute  the  percentages-of-time  for the call graph.
           More than  one  --EE  option  may  be  given;  only  one
           _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e may be indicated with each --EE option.

       "-f function_name"
           The  --ff  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n  option  causes "gprof" to limit the
           call graph  to  the  function  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e  and  its
           children  (and  their  children...).  More than one --ff
           option may be given; only  one  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e  may  be
           indicated with each --ff option.

       "-F function_name"
           The --FF _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n option works like the "-f" option, but
           only time spent in the function and its children  (and
           their  children...)  will  be used to determine total-
           time and percentages-of-time for the call graph.  More
           than   one   --FF   option   may   be  given;  only  one
           _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n___n_a_m_e may be indicated with  each  --FF  option.
           The --FF option overrides the --EE option.

       The  granularity  of  the  sampling  is shown, but remains
       statistical at best.  We assume that  the  time  for  each
       execution of a function can be expressed by the total time
       for the function  divided  by  the  number  of  times  the
       function  is  called.   Thus the time propagated along the
       call graph arcs to  the  function's  parents  is  directly
       proportional to the number of times that arc is traversed.

       Parents that are not themselves  profiled  will  have  the

       time  of  their  profiled children propagated to them, but
       they will appear to be spontaneously invoked in  the  call
       graph  listing,  and  will  not have their time propagated
       further.   Similarly,   signal   catchers,   even   though
       profiled, will appear to be spontaneous (although for more
       obscure  reasons).   Any  profiled  children   of   signal
       catchers  should  have  their  times  propagated properly,
       unless the signal catcher was invoked during the execution
       of the profiling routine, in which case all is lost.

       The   profiled  program  must  call  "exit"(2)  or  return
       normally for the profiling information to be saved in  the
       _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t file.
